      "BREAKING TONIGHT, EXACTLY SIX WEEKS BEFORE PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP TAKES THE OATH OF OFFICE. PRESIDENT OBAMA OESRDERS A NEW INTELLIGENCE REVIEW AIMED AT ALLEGED EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 ELECTION. WELCOME TO \"THE KELLY FILE.\" I'M SANDRA SMITH IN FOR MEGYN KELLY. THE REVIEWS COMES AFTER THE DNC AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAD EMBARRASSING E-MAILS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SUSPECTS THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WAS BEHIND THE DNC ATTACK. THE REVIEW IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE PRESIDENT OBAMA LEAVES OFFICE. AS FOR MR. TRUMP, HE WAS IN MICHIGAN TONIGHT AS PART OF HIS THANK YOU TOUR BUT DID NOT ADDRESS THE CONTROVERSY. IN MOMENTS, WE WILL TALK TO MR. CHRIS STIREWALT ABOUT THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF ALL OF THIS. WE'LL BE JOINED BY GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE. BUT WE BEGIN WITH KEVIN CORK REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON.  >> GOOD EVENING. A FULL REVIEW, THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ORDERING HIS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO CONDUCT INTO THE HACKING ACTIVITY IN THE 2016 ELECTION. NOW THIS REVIEW COMES AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY ACCUSED RUSSIA OF CONDUCTING MANY OF THE HACKS THAT SURFACED DURING THE RUNUP TO THE ELECTION. IT DID DENY THERE WAS ANY IMPACT ON THE ACTUAL VOTING OUTCOME. BUT THE DEPOSIT ANY COMMISSIONER SAID IT'S TIME TO TAKE STOCK OF THE U.S. CYBER DEFENSE CAPABILITIES AND REDUCE FUTURE THREATS.  >> IT'S TO CAPTURE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT AND TO REPORT TO A RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS TO INCLUDE THE CONGRESS.  >> WE'RE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTION AND THIS REPORT WILL DIG INTO THIS PATTERN OF MALICIOUS CYBER ACTIVITY TIED TO OUR ELECTIONS.  >> SCHULTZ SAYS THE PRESIDENT EXPECTS THE REPORT TO BE ON HIS DEC DESK BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE IN JANUARY. THIS REVIEW IS HAPPENING AFTER THE DEMOCRATS LOST IN THE GENERAL ELECTION INSTEAD OF SAY VICTORIES IN 2008 AND 2012 AND THAT'S LED SOME TO ACCUSE THE ADMINISTRATION OF PARTISANSHIP. BUT EXPERTS SAY THAT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY.  >> WHAT'S UNUSUAL IS THE CYBER FEATURE, THE ABILITY TO HACK E-MAILS, DUMP LARGE AMOUNTS OF DOCUMENTS. THAT'S HAVING AN OUTSIDE INFLUENCE SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING THAT APPROPRIATELY.  >> SPECIFICIALLY SAYING THE PERSON WHO STANDS TO BENEFIT FROM THIS KIND OF REVIEW IS DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF, NOT THE PRESIDENT. BACK TO YOU.  >> SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED BY ALL OF THIS? CHRIS STIREWALT IS OUR FOX NEWS DIGITAL EDITOR. SO CHRIS DID RUSSIA TRY TO DISRUPT AMERICAN ELECTIONS? THAT'S THE HOTLY CONTESTED DEBATE RIGHT NOW.  >> WELL, OF COURSE. OF COURSE THEY DID. WHY IS EVERYBODY ACTING SO SURPRISED THAT RUSSIA WHICH HATES THE WEST AND NATO, WHICH WANTS TO DISRUPT THE WEST AND NATO TRIED TO DISRUPT OUR ELECTIONS. THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II AND EXCEPT FOR A TEN-YEAR HIATUS, THIS HAS BEEN THE M.O. FOR THE KREMLIN WHETHER THEY BE SOVIETS OR UNDER THE PUTIN REGIME. TO UNDERMINE ELECTIONS AND AS WE CAN SAY FROM THE PARTISAN RESPONSES TODAY, IT'S WORKING.  >> WITH THE ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT AMERICAN ELECTIONS BY FAVORING ONE CANDIDATE OVER ANOTHER? LIKE FAVORING HILLARY CLINTON OVER DONALD TRUMP OR DONALD TRUMP OVER HILLARY CLINTON? IS IT PARTISAN?  >> WASHINGTON POST REPORTING TONIGHT AND WHAT WOULD SEEM TO BE QUITE APPARENT WAS THAT TRUMP WAS THE PREFERRED CANDIDATE FOR THE RUSSIANS AND THEIR HACKERS. BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT. YES, IN THE PAST THEY'VE PREFERRED LEFT CANDIDATES. MAYBE NOW THEY PREFER RIGHT CANDIDATES. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS MORE SYMPATHETIC TO THE POSITION OF THE KREMLIN. AND TRUMP HAS MADE SO SECRET OF THE FACT THAT HE WANTS TO DO BUSINESS WITH PUTIN AND DO BUSINESS THERE. SO I'M SURE THEY PREFERRED HIM. BUT THE POINT IS TO UNDERMINE THE CONFIDENCE, ULTIMATE POINT IS UNDER MINE CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM. TO MAKE AMERICANS AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE WEST IN NATO COUNTRIES DOUBT THE SYSTEM AND DESPISE ONE ANOTHER. AND IF YOU CAN DO THAT BY UNDERMINING THE SYSTEM BY WHICH WE CHOOSE OUR DUALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON, IF YOU CAN UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN THAT, IS THE NEWS FAKE, U IF YO CAN SEW THAT OUT THERE, YOU CAN HURT AMERICA.  \n",

WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME? WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO SAYS THAT'S EVIDENCE OF THIS HACK. YOU'RE SAYING IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO DO THIS BUT IS THERE ANY HARD EVIDENCE?  >> WELL, EITHER WE BELIEVE OUR SECURITY APPARATUS OR WE DON'T. IF WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW THAT WE SAY OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS LYING TO US, THEN WE'RE WAY OVER NIAGRA. THEN WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT ON ITS FACE. BUT REMEMBER, THE PROBLEM HERE IS AGAIN PARTISAN RANKER. REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT THE FINDINGS BECAUSE IT MAKES THEIR GUY LOOK BAD. DEMOCRATS ARE CLINGING TO IT LIKE LIFE ITSELF BECAUSE IT GIVES THEM AN EXCUSE WHY A HEAVILY FAVORED CANDIDATE WENT DOWN IN A NARROW ELECTION. IT'S BETTER TO BLAME IT ON THE RUSSIANS THAN IT IS TO BLAME IT ON THEIR CANDIDATE WASN'T VERY GOOD AT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  >> JOINING US NOW, FORMER GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE AND JULIE ROGINSKY. GOVERNOR HUCKABEE, I WANT TO GET IN THERE ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS. HE SAID I DON'T BELIEVE THEY INTERFER INTERFERED. EVERY TIME I DO SOMETHING THEY SAY RUSSIA INTERFERED. IT COULD BE RUSSIA, COULD BE CHINA, COULD BE SOME GUY IN HIS HOME IN NEW JERSEY.  >> LET'S ASSUME THAT RUSSIA DID HACK INTO IT. IT SAYS LESS ABOUT OUR LACK OF CYBER DEFENSES THAN IT DOES THAT RUSSIA WOULD TRY TO HACK INTO EVERY AMERICAN SYSTEM IT CAN. DO YOU THINK FOR A MINUTE IF THEY CAN GET INTO DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN E-MAILS THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT? OF COURSE THEY WOULD HAVE. I AGREE WITH CHRIS ABOUT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THIS NOTION THAT RUSSIA WANTED DONALD TRUMP TO WIN IS NONSENSE. THE LAST PERSON THEY WANT IN THE OVAL OFFICE IS DONALD TRUMP. FOR EIGHT YEARS THEY'VE DONE WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO. THEY WANTED TO INVADE CRIMEA, THEY DID IT. THEY WANT TO FLY FLIGHTER JETS 30 FEET OVER THE HEADS OF AN AMERICAN DESTROYER IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS, THEY DID IT. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT KIND OF STUFF UNDER DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S BRINGING IN A NEW APPROACH THAT AMERICA ISN'T GOING TO SIT BACK AND TAKE IT IN THE TEETH.  >> CLINTON SUPPORTERS ARE ADAMANT ABOUT BLAMING RUSSIA FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S LOSS CHBL.  >> THE ONLY THING I'M BLAMING RUSSIA FOR IS IT SEEMS THAT SENATOR McCAIN, SENATOR GRAHAM, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, BOTH REPUBLICANS, ALL AGREE THAT RUSSIA MOST LIKELY HACKED. AND QUITE HONESTLY IF THEY DID, WE NEED A NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE AND PART OF IT NEEDS TO BE DECLASSIFIED SO THAT AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SOME ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. THIS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS THE WORD OF OUR LEADERS.  >> LET ME SAY SOMETHING QUICKLY ABOUT WHAT GOVERNOR HUCKABEE SAID. WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT-ELECT WHO ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE RUSSIANS HAS INVADED CRIMEA, SAID PUBLICLY THAT HE MIGHT BE OKAY WITH CRIMEA BEING PART OF RUSSIA AND NOT UKRAINE, SAYING HE WANTS TO \n",

      "JULIE, AGAIN, THAT'S NONSENSE. HERE'S WHY. WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT WITH NATO IS MAKING IT SO THAT THE UNITED STATES ISN'T PICKING UP THE ENTIRE CHECK FOR THE MEAL WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE HAD THE BUFFET AND WE HAD THE SALAD. I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP IS READY TO DESTROY NATO BUT NATO HASN'T HAD AN EFFECTIVE STANCE AGAINST STOPPING THE AGGRESSIVE MOVES OF RUSSIA OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. AS FAR AS THE HACKS, LET ME MAKE ONE POINT VERY CLEAR. IT SEEMS THAT DEMOCRATS ARE MORE EMBARRASSED THAT THE RUSSIANS HACKED THE SYSTEM WHICH IS A MAJOR CONCERN AND I DO THINK THAT THAT'S A BIPARTISAN CONCERN, BUT WHY AREN'T THEY JUST AS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THOSE HACKS REVEALED, THAT THE DEMOCRATS --  >> BUT THEY ARE, GOVERNOR HUCKABEE. CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS ARE CALLING FOR THIS TOO. THEY WANT TO LEARN FROM IT AND FIND OUT WHY IT HAPPENED AND HOW IT HAPPENED.  >> SURE.  >> BUT DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE DOESN'T. I MEAN IS THAT SETTING UP FOR A CLASH WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?  >> NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK CONGRESS HAS EVER RIGHT -- AND I THINK FRANKLY THEY'VE GOT A RESPONSIBILITY TO INVESTIG FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYING HE DOESN'T KNOW. AT THIS POINT MAYBE HE DOESN'T KNOW.  >> SO JULIE --  >> BUT TO SAY HE DOESN'T CARE I DON'T THINK IS FAIR.  >> A LITTLE KNOWN FACTS ABOUT YOU SINCE YOU'RE FAMILIAR TO THIS AUDIENCE. A POLITICAL REFUGEE FROM RUSSIA, 1980. A GRADUATE DEGREE IN RUSSIAN STUDIES. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING BY SAYING YOU WANT THIS FULLY INVESTIGATED AND RETALIATE IN KIND. WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?  >> WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS THAT WE HAVE MEANS -- I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE START WORLD WAR III. WE HAVE MEANS TO CUT OFF THEIR MEANS. WE HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS IN THE CITY OF LONDON HERE IN NEW YORK AND REAL ESTATE. WE HAVE ACCESS TO HURT VLADIMIR PUTIN. I'M NOT SUGGESTING HURTING THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, HURTING HIS INNER CIRCLE. WHEN YOU HAVE A MEMBER OF THE PARTY SAYING, YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE MAY HAVE HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WIKILEAKS, SAYING THAT PUBLICLY RIGHT AFTER OUR ELECTION, I WOULD TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD AND I WOULD TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE GLOATING OVER THIS. AS TO NATO, I GUESS WHEN RUSSIAN TANKS START E MASSING AT THE BORDER, THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IS GOING TO SEND A CHECK AND THEN MAYBE WE'LL CONSIDER COMING TO THEIR DEFENSE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S HOW OUR NATO ALLIANCES WORKED SINCE THE 1940s AND IT SHOULD NOT WORK THAT WAY NOW.  >> GOVERNOR HUCKABEE, LAST WORD TO YOU.  >> IF YOU THINK JIM MAD DOG MATTIS IS GOING TO SIT BACK AND LET THE RUSSIANS DO WHATEVER THEY WISH TO DO, YOU CLEARLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHO THIS MAN IS AND THE KIND OF CALIBER THAT HE'S GOING TO BRING TO THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT. THERE'S IN REASON AT ALL TO BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL BE ANYTHING LESS THAN A STRONG PRESIDENT, MUCH STRONGER THAN THE ONE IN OFFICE THAT WE'VE HAD IN OFFICE FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS WHO STOOD BACK, HANDS IN THE POCKETS AS THE RUSSIANS DID WHAT THEY WISH.  >> THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU.  \n",

A FEW MONTHS AGO WE SUGGESTED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA MIGHT WANT TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST RUSSIA FOR WAGING CYBER WARFARE AGAINST THE U.S.A. RUSSIA HAS BEEN HACKING INTO THE AMERICAN SYSTEM FOR YEARS. MR. OBAMA DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT. NOW, THE SITUATION HAS REACHED CRITICAL MASS BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON LOST THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND AS WE ALL KNOW, WIKILEAKS EMBARRASSED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN BY MAKING PUBLIC HACKED EMAILS THAT SHOWED SOME MEMBERS OF THE PRESS SECRETLY HELPING MRS. CLINTON AND OTHER EMBARRASSING FACTS. BEFORE THAT, DEMOCRATS REALLY DIDN'T CARE MUCH ABOUT RUSSIAN HACKING. NOW THEY DO. CIA AND THE FBI BOTH AGREE THAT RUSSIA IS INVOLVED WITH BREACHING U.S. CYBER SECURITY. THE CIA SAYS IT IS BECAUSE THEY WANTED IT INFLUENCE THE ELECTION. THE FBI SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW THE MOTIVE. IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER, DOES IT? IF RUSSIAN OFFICIALS ARE HACKING INTO AMERICAN SYSTEMS, THAT'S CYBER WARFARE. ENTER DONALD TRUMP WHO SAYS HE DOES NOT BELIEVE RUSSIANS DID ANYTHING TO INFLUENCE THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE. HE SAYS THE DEMOCRATS ARE JUST TRY POSITION TROT OUT ANOTHER EXCUSE FOR LOSING. OKAY. HIS OPINION. HE'S ENTITLED TO IT. IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AVOIDS THIS ISSUE ALL TOGETHER MR. TRUMP HAS NOTHING TO GAIN HERE. NOTHING AGAIN THIS HAPPENED ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S WATCH. IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR HOLDING THE RUSSIANS RESPONSIBLE. GOING FORWARD PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH CYBER WARFARE. RIGHT NOW HE SHOULD SIT THE WHOLE THING OUT. ON ANOTHER SERIOUS NOTE, PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IS ENGAGED IN A WAR OF WORDS WITH CHINA. MR. TRUMP TELLING CHRIS WALLACE THE ONE CHINA POLICY WHEREBY THE U.S.A. RECOGNIZES THE BEIJING GOVERNMENT AS A SOLE AUTHORITY WHERE TAIWAN IS INVOLVED MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD THING. CHINA DOESN'T LIKE THAT. AGAIN, IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF MR. TRUMP POSTPONES THIS CONFRONTATION UNTIL HE IS IN OFFICE AND FULLY BRIEFED ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF A WAR OF WORDS WITH THE CHINESE. PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE DEALS WITH CHINA. WHY T THEM OFF NOW? FINALLY, DONALD TRUMP'S APPOINTMENTS TO ME, THEY LOOKED FINE. IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THESE CABINET MEMBERS HAVE TREMENDOUS POWER. THEY DON'T. THEY DO WHAT THEY'RE TOLD TO DO. AND ALL THE PEOPLE APPOINTED SO FAR HAVE SKILL AND EXPERIENCE. FOX NEWS IS NOW REPORTING THAT CEO OF EXXON REX TILLERSON IS TRUMP'S PICK FOR SECRETARY OF STATE. I HAVE NEVER MET MR. TILLERSON. I KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HIM. ALTHOUGH REPORTS ARE THAT HE HAS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. MAYBE TILLERSON CAN NEUTRALIZE PUTIN'S BAD BEHAVIOR. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING. I EXPECT MR. TILLERSON TO BE CONFIRMED IN THE SENATE DESPITE ALL THE WHINING. SUMMING UP, RUSSIAN HACKING HAPPENED. PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT HE DID NOT. IF IT CONTINUES, PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL HAVE TO. ON CHINA, LET'S AWLG ALL TAKE IT EASY. ON TRUMP'S APPOINTMENT THEY LOOK GOOD TO AMERICANS WITH NO IDEOLOGICAL ACTS. AND THAT'S THE MEMO. NOW FOR THE TOP STORY. WHO IS THIS GUY REX TILLERSON. WITH US MARIA BARTIROMO, 3 HOUR BLOCK ON FOX BUSINESS NETWORK EACH MORNING WHO KNOWS ALL THE BIG SHOTS NOT JUST REX TILLERSON. EVERY BIG SHOT IN THE WORLD MARIA KNOWS THEM. YOU AND TILLERSON GO WAY BACK, RIGHT?  \n",

THE TEN MEMBERS OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SAY IT'S NOT THEIR DUTY TO RUBBER STAMP THE RESULTS BUT TO INSTEAD INVESTIGATE, DISCUSS AND DLIB RA RATE. THEY SENT A LETTER TO JAMES CLAPPER ASKING TO BE GIVEN AN INTEL BRIEFING BEFORE THEY CAST THEIR VOTES ON DECEMBER 19th, WRITING, QUOTE, THE ELECTOR IS REQUIRED TO KNOW FROM THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHETHER THERE ARE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BETWEEN TIES TO DONALD TRUMP, HIS CAMPAIGN OR ASSOCIATES AND RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION. THE E LECTERS COME ON TO SAY THE INFORMATION WILL HELP THEM DECIDE WHETHER MR. TRUMP IS FIT TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS BACKING THIS DECISION, DESPITE REPAID EDLY SAYING THEY'RE SEPTEMBER THE RESULTS. JOHN PODESTA CALLS THE GROUP BIPARTISAN BUT HE SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ONE OF THE TEN MEMBERS IS A REPUBLICAN AND SHE HAS LONG BEEN A REPUBLICAN. THIS LETTER COMES ON THE HEELS OF THIS WEEKEND'S TWO DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMEN WHO SUGGEST THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SHOULD CONSIDER BLOCKING TRUMP'S ELECTION. WATCH.  >> WHAT FINALLY PUSHED ME OVER THE EDGE WAS WHEN THE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES CRITICIZED THE CIA AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THE LEADERS IN BEIJING AND MOSCOW AND TEHRAN ARE WATCHING AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT CRITICIZE HIS INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND STAND UP FOR THE DEFENSE OF RUSSIA?  >> AND WHILE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT LARGELY BELIEVES THAT RUSSIA DID INTERFERE WITH THE CAMPAIGN, THERE IS DISAGREEMENT OVER THE MOTIVE. THE CIA BELIEVES IT WAS TO HELP TRUMP. THE FBI BELIEVES IT WAS TO UNDERMINE THE U.S. POLITICAL SYSTEM.

THANKS FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS THAT THE ELECTORS MAY HAVE BEEN NINE COME FROM STATES WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WON. IS THIS MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING? WHAT IS THE POINT?  >> LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK HERE. MY GOODNESS. REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN THE PARTY OF RONALD REAGAN WAS TALKING TO VERY POSSIBLY TO MIKHAIL GORBACHEV TO TEAR DOWN THE WALL.

THEY RELEASED INFORMATION THAT WAS DETRIMENTAL TO THE DNC, IT WASN'T GOOD FOR ONE SIDE OF THE TICKET MUCH MORE THAN IT WASN'T GOOD FOR THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TICKET.  >> WELL, OF COURSE. I MEAN THERE'S HACKING GOING ON ALL OF THE TIME. THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTION PROCESS ITSELF. THAT'S THE ACCUSATION THAT'S BEING MADE HERE AND THAT'S WHAT THE US WHAT CAME OUT AND SAID THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A PARTY LOST HANDEDLY AND THEY CANNOT COPE WITH IT. PERHAPS THIS IS A JUST A DISTRACTION OF A MOTION THAT WAS FILED LAST WEEK BY JUDICIAL WATCH WANTING TO UNSEAL THE VIDEO DEPOSITIONS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S TOP STAFFER IRS IN THE INVESTIGATION OF HER E-MAILS. THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON WITH THE ELECTION PROCESS. THE WHITE HOUSE CAME OUT TODAY AND SAID IT.  >> THE PRESIDENT ORDERED THAT HE WANTS A FULL REVIEW OF RUSSIAN HACKING BACK TO THE 2008 ELECTION. WE WANTS IT ALL DONE BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE ON JANUARY 20th.

AUSTAN, I WANT TO START WITH YOU. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP SAID IN RESPONSE THIS WEEKEND WAS THERE HAVE BEEN A LITANY OF EXCUSES. THIS IS THE LATEST ONE AND WHAT IT CAME DOWN TO WAS THE POLLING SHOWED PEOPLE DIDN'T TRUST HER, THEY DIDN'T LIKE HER OR CONNECT WITH HER. THE VOTES ARE THERE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE RUSSIANS HACKING INTO MACHINES AND CHANGING VOTES, RIGHT?  >> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. AND I'M NOT ADVOCATING THAT THEY GO DOWN AND SAY LET'S TRY TO REVERSE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE WEIRD. I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE JUSTIFIABLE HOWLS FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE ABOUT DOING THAT. BUT I THINK THE WAY YOU HAVE PORTRAYED IT, THAT THIS IS A FLIP-FLOP BY THE MEDIA, I THINK, IS VERY MISLEADING. BECAUSE THE THING THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS CONDEMNED FOR RIGHTFULLY BY PEOPLE IN BOTH PARTIES WAS FOR ALLEGING THAT THE VOTE WAS RIGGED IF HE LOST WITH NO EVIDENCE AHEAD OF TIME. THAT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN IF THERE ACTUALLY IS EVIDENCE OF FOREIGN INFLUENCE, WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE IT. THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AT ALL.  >> WHAT HE GOT PUSHBACK FOR DURING THE DEBATE WHEN HE SAID WE ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION, HE SAID, WE'RE GOING TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. HE WASN'T TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING BEING RIGGED. THAT'S WHEN WE SAW MRS. CLINTON GO ON --  >> NOT THE CASE.  >> SAYING YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS WHEN YOU DON'T LIKE THEM. SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW DENIGRATING IT IS TO THE SYSTEM.  >> TO SUGGEST THAT IT IS RIGGED WITH NO EVIDENCE BEFORE THE OUTCOME THEN TO LITERALLY SAY IF I DO NOT WIN THEN IT IS RIGGED BY MY OPPONENT, THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THERE'S ACTUAL EVIDENCE FROM THE CIA THAT THE REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE SENATE AND THE REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE HOUSE SAY NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SITUATION.  >> GOVERNOR HUCKABEE, I WANT TO BRING YOU MANY HERE. WHAT WE'RE GETTING ARE LEAKS FROM AN UNNAMED SOURCE SAYING THAT YES, EVERYBODY AGREES THAT THERE WAS SOME UNTOWARD ACTION BY RUSSIAN ACTORS POTENTIALLY LINKED TO THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. BUT TO MAKE THE LEAP THAT THEY CHANGED THE ELECTION RESULTS IS A BIG ONE.  >> THAT'S BEYOND ANY BELIEF. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN UNICORN TO GO THERE. THE FACT IS THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE RUSSIANS MAY HAVE HACKED INTO THE DNC COMPUTERS BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT IT HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE ELECTION. MY GOSH, WE JUST GOT WORD TONIGHT THAT THEY RECOUNTED THE VOTES IN WISCONSIN AND DONALD TRUMP HADS 162 MORE VOTES THAN WHEN THEY FIRST COUNTED. THIS IS SO UNBELIEVABLE. I'M ASHAMED FOR THE DEMOCRATS AND THE PRESS. BUT THEN I REPEAT MYSELF. BECAUSE WHEN THE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" HAVE TO DIG OUT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BIRD CAPABLE TO SEE WHAT THEY WROTE EIGHT WEEKS AGO WHEN THEY WERE WHINING ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING SOMETHING THEN THEY TURN AROUND AND SAY THE SAME THING, YOU KNOW WHAT THE EVIDENCE OF A RIGGED ELECTION WAS? THE EXPOSURE OF THE E-MAILS SHOWING IT WAS RIGGED BETWEEN BERNIE SANDERS AND HILLARY CLINTON. IT WAS A FIXED DEAL. I THINK THE MORE AMAZING THING IS THOSE DNC E-MAILS REVEALED JUST THE CONTEMPT THAT HILLARY AND HER CHIEF LIEUTENANTS HAD FOR THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE OF AMERICA. AND THAT'S WHY SHE LOST. AND DEMOCRATS NEED TO ACCEPT THE RESULT OS F A FAIR AND FREE ELECTION WHICH IS WHAT THEY LECTURED REPUBLICANS ABOUT.  \n"

      "BREAKING TONIGHT, PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP'S RUMORED PICK FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE ISRUSSIA'S AO THE ELECTIONS. MR. BOLTON WENT ON TO CLARIFY THIS MORNING THAT THIS IS NOT WHAT HE MEANT. HE DIDN'T MEAN IT WAS ABOUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. JOINING ME NOW IS JUDGE NAPOLITANO WHO RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF THE HACKING COMING FROM INSIDE OUR GOVERNMENT IN AUGUST. YOU HAVE A KRYSTAL BACRYSTAHRIR?  >> I RAISED IT THEN BEN FORMER MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS IN THE NSA NOW RETIRED HAS RAISED IT AND SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS ANIMUS AGAINST MRS. CLINTON IN THE NSA AND NSA PEOPLE WHO KNOW ALL, SEE ALL, THEY KNOW ABOUT ALL OF THE LEEKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE RECORDS OF IT BECAUSE THEY CONTROL ALL OF THE FIBER OPTICS IN THE COUNTRY WOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS. THERE'S HACKING AND THERE'S LEAKING. LEAKING IS WHEN SOMEONE INTERNALLY OR REMOTELY REVEALS INFORMATION IMPROPERLY TO A THIRD PARTY. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO MRS. CLINTON. IT HAPPENED DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY, 47, 48,000 E-MAILS THAT WERE LEAKED. HACKING IS WHEN SOMEONE REMOTELY ENTERS AN INFORMATION SYSTEM AND ALTERED IT REMOTELY. SO THAT THE OPERATOR OF THE SYSTEM DOESN'T KNOW THERE WAS AN ALTERATION. THAT IS WHAT DID NOT HAPPEN HERE. NO MATTER WHAT THE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" AND THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" ARE OPINING THIS MORNING, THEY CANNOT POINT TO ANY EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION WAS ALTERED BY FOREIGN AGENTS. THERE CERTAINLY WAS LEAKING, THAT LEAKING COULD HAVE BEEN FACILITATED BY PEOPLE IN THE NSA, BY A ROGUE IN MRS. CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN OR BY A FOREIGN ENTITY. BUT THAT WAS A LEAK. THAT WAS NOT A HACK.  >> JUDGE, CAN DID HAVE SOME POLLING AROUND THE TIME THAT ALL OF THESE LEAKS WERE BUBBLING UP. THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO SAID THEIR VOTE WOULD POTENTIALLY BE CHANGED BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS REVEALED IN THE LEAKING. COU .  >> IF THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIA DID THE LEAKING. BUT THE LEAKING PROBABLY CAME FROM SOMEONE INSIDE OR SOMEONE WHO HAD ACCESS THROUGH THE FIBER OPTICS THROUGH WHAT THE COMMUNICATIONS RAN, SOMEBODY IN THE NSA OR SOMEBODY WHO WAS ONCE IN THE NSA. WE KNOW IT BECAUSE FOR BETTER OR WORSE, WHATEVER YOU THINK OF THEM, EDWARD SNOWDEN WE VEELD A REVEALED ALL OF THIS AND THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE NSA'S TENTACLES IN ALL OF THE FIBER OPTIC TRAFFIC IN THE UNITED STATES. NOT TO GET TOO MUCH IN THE WEEDS, THE LEAKING COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT THE NSA KNOWING ABOUT IT. AND IF ANYBODY HACKED IN AND ALTERED INTERNAL SYSTEMS, THE NSA WOULD KNOW WHO THE HACKER WAS AND WHEN THEY DID IT. WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY OF THAT.  >> JUDGE, GREAT TO SEE YOU.  \n",

ANOTHER EXCUSE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY. AND I THINK IT'S JUST -- YOU KNOW, THEY TALK ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THING. IT'S ANOTHER EXCUSE. WE HAD A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. THE FINAL NUMBERS NOW ARE AT 306 AND SHE'S DOWN TO A VERY LOW NUMBER. NO, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT AT ALL.  >> SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ARE REPORTEDLY TAKING ISSUE WITH NO THOSE COMMENTS.

IT'S DIFFERENT THAN SAYING MATERIAL WAS LEAKED THAT WAS UNFLATTERING TO THE CANDIDATES.  >> NO QUESTION. AND THE POINT THAT YOU MADE IN THE EARLIER SEGMENT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT ANYBODY MESSED AROUND WITH THE VOTING MACHINES OR THE ACTUAL VOTE. WE DO NOW HAVE EVIDENCE FROM 17 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE JUDGE'S RETIRED FOLKS FROM THE IC, THE AGENCIES THEMSELVES ARE REPORTING THAT IT IS THE RUSH SHAPS W SHANS WHO WENT IN, GOT EVIDENCE FROM PODESTA'S E-MAILS AND MADE THOSE PUBLIC. THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS FOR A HOSTILE COUNTRY TO BE MUCKING AND WITH OUR ELECTIONS. THEY DEFINITELY WERE TRYING TO HAVE AN IMPACT AND THAT'S SCARY.  >> EVERYONE SHOULD CARE ABOUT THIS AND WANT ANSWERS.  >> EVERYONE SHOULD CARE BUT TO WHAT EXTENT AND WHY TO DEMOCRATS CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS AT THIS POINT IN TIME. IT'S OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. THIS IS PART OF A BROADER NARRATIVE, THE FACT THAT RUSSIA DID SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE INFLUENCED SOME PEOPLE AT SOME POINT IN THE ELECTION WITH THAT DONALD TRUMP IS AIL ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT. WHETHER IT'S THE FBI THREW THE ELECTION FOR TRUMP. THERE'S BEEN A SLEW OF STORIES, ONE AFTER THE OTHER, ALL WITH THE SAME INTENT, TO ESSENTIALLY UNELECT DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT IN THE EYES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, TO TAKE THAT NOT MY PRESIDENT MEME AND MAKE IT REAL FOR PEOPLE. HE'S NOT ACTUALLY YOUR PRESIDENT BECAUSE RUSSIA GOT HIM ELECTED. THIS WAS WRITTEN TODAY IN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" THAT IT'S NOT A REAL ELECTION, THAT RUSSIA THREW THIS FOR HIM. THAT'S NONSENSE. WHAT RUSSIA'S INTENT AND THE EXTENT OF ITS INVOLVEMENT ARE OPEN QUESTIONS BUT THE MEDIA IS TRYING TO RUSH UP THE INFORMATION NOW.  >> I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND. BUT THE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" WRITING ABOUT THIS SAID IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT TIN TENT WAS TO GO IN AND INFLUENCE THIS ELECTION FOR DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S COMING FROM THE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\"  >> THAT'S RIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE THE FAINTEST IDEA WHAT THEIR INTENT WAS. WE HAVE SOME CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE PEOPLE AROUND TRUMP AND TRUMP HIMSELF WE ARE A LOT MORE FRIENDLY WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. WHAT WE NEED AND I THINK WHAT MOST RESPONSIBLE DEMOCRATS WANT IS A REAL INVESTIGATION INTO THIS EFFORTS ON THE PART OF A MAJOR GLOBAL ADVERSARY TO IMPACT OUR ELECTIONS. IF THE SHOE WERE ON THE OTHER FOOT AND CLINTON HAD BEEN ELECTED AND THIS WAS ALLEGED ABOUT HER, REPUBLICANS WOULD BE GOING BANANAS.  >> I HAVE TO THINK IF TRUMP WAS MAKING THIS ALLEGATIONS HAVING LOST, THEY WOULD NOT BE RECEIVED WELL.  >> BUT AGAIN KEEP IN CONTEXT, THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ANYTHING CAME FROM THIS, IT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR SOME TIME. THIS IS NOT NEW BY THE WAY THAT FOREIGN COUNTRIES WOULD UNDERSTAND FLUNS ANOTH INFLUENCE ANOTHER COUNTRY'S ELECTION. BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT IT GIVES THE DEMOCRATS A TINY VIOLIN THEY CAN PLAY ABOUT HOW SAD THEY ARE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP WINNING THE ELECTION.  \n",

PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP REACTED TO THESE REPORTS ON FAX NEWS SUNDAY. TAKE A LOOK.  >> I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS. IT'S JUST ANOTHER EXCUSE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY AND I THINK IT'S JUST -- YOU KNOW, THEY TALKED ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS. EVERY WEEK IT'S ANOTHER EXCUSE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE STORY AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY SAID, THERE'S GREAT CONFUSION. HACKING IS VERY INTERESTING. ONCE THEY HACK, IF YOU DON'T CATCH THEM IN THE ACT, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CATCH THEM. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER IT'S RUSSIA OR CHINA OR SOMEBODY. COULD BE SOMEBODY SITTING IN A BED SOME PLACE. THEY HAVE NO IDEA.  >> WHOI WOULD THE CIA PUT OUT THE STORY THAT THE RUSSIANS WANTED YOU TO WIN?  >> I'M NOT SURE THEY PUT IT OUT. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING IT OUT BECAUSE THEY SUFFERED ONE OF THE GREATEST DEFEATS IN TERMS OF POLITICS IN THE COUNTRY AND I THINK THEY'RE PUTTING IT OUT.  >> THIS MORNING PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP TWEETED CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE DIFFERENT AND WE TRIED TO PLAY THE RUSSIAN-CIA CARD. IT COULD BE CALLED A CONSPIRACY. EARLIER TODAY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER, JOHN PODESTA SAID THAT ELECTORAL COLLEGE ELECTORS HAVE THE RIGHT TO THIS INFORMATION BEFORE THEY VOTE ON DECEMBER 19th. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THE TABLES WERE TURNED AND IT WAS DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN TRYING TO DO THIS, THIS LEFT WOULD GO NUTS. BEFORE WE GET INTO THE HYPOCRISY ON THIS ISSUE, LET'S LAY THE FOUNDATION. THE LEFT'S RECOUNT SCHEME FAILED AND FAILED MISERABLY. SO NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BLAME THE RUSSIANS, BLAME HACKING. THERE'S NO SMOKING GUN. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS PRESIDENT OBAMA, THE DEMOCRATS, THEY'RE TRYING TO POLITICIZE THIS ISSUE TO TRY AND HURT AND DELEGITIMIZE DONALD TRUMP. THE FBI IS NOW REACHING A MUCH DIFFERENT CONCLUSION THAT THE CIA ON ALL OF THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT FOUND CONCLUSIONIVE EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIA WAS TRYING TO HELP TRUMP WIN THE ELECTION. AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE SAYING THAT THE CIA'S ASSESSMENT OF WHAT HAPPENED ISN'T AS CLEAR-CUT AND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS REPORTING. THERE'S NO CONSENSUS BETWEEN THE FBI AND THE CIA. AND ACCORDING TO THE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" THERE'S NO NEW INFORMATION, INTELLIGENCE OR EVIDENCE FROM THE CIA'S INVESTIGATION INTO HIS ALLEGATIONS SO THEN WHY IS THIS ALL OF THE SUDDEN A BIG STORY? THE DAILY BEAST IS ALSO RORKT THAT THERE'S A REVOLT GOING ON INSIDE THE CIA. WHY? BECAUSE EMPLOYEES QUOTE HATE TRUMP'S GUTS AND THEY DON'T LIKE HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER NOMINEE RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN. THEN YOU HAVE NEVER TRUMPERS LIKE SENATOR McCAIN AND LINDSEY GRAHAM, THEY'RE JOINING CHUCK SCHUMER FOR A BIPARTISAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SO-CALLED HACKING WHEN WE HAVE NO NEW INFORMATION, NOTHING NEW FROM BEFORE THE ELECTION. WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED WE ANY OF THIS WAS THEY ALL HAVE ONE THING IN CONNELL MON. THEY HATE PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP. IF ALL OF THESE PEOPLE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THE RUSSIAN ALLEGATIONS, WHY DIDN'T THEY FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT SECRETARY CLINIC'S PRIVATE E-MAIL SCANDAL. YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN THE FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY SAID THAT THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT THAT FOREIGN ACTORS GAINED ACCESS INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS. REMEMBER THIS.  \n",

BUT GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM AND OF THE ACTORS POTENTIALLY INVOLVED, WE ASSESS WE WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO SEE SUCH DIRECT EVIDENCE. WE DO ASSESS THAT HOSTILE ACTORS GAINED ACCESS TO THE PRIVATE COMMERCIAL E-MAIL ACCOUNTS OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM SECRETARY CLINTON WAS IN REGULAR CONTACT FROM HER PERSONAL ACCOUNT.  >> AND DON'T FORGET DIRECTOR COMEY, HE SAID CLINTON'S PRIVATE SERVER WAS LESS SECURE THAN A GMAIL ACCOUNT. AND ACCORDING TO BRET BAIER'S REPORTING, AUTHORITIES BELIEVED THERE WAS A 95% CHANCE THAT UP TO FIVE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES MAY HAVE ACCESSED CLINTON'S SERVER AND TAKEN E-MAIL. WHERE WAS THE GREAT OUTRAGE FROM THE LEFT THAT IS ALL UP IN ARMS NOW. AND IF THEY'RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT INTERFERENCE AND INFLUENCE, WHY DIDN'T THEY CARE ABOUT THE MEDIA AND THEIR COLLUSION WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN? REMEMBER WIKILEAKS? THEY EXPOSED HOW THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WAS CAUGHT READ HANDED. WHAT WERE THEY TRYING TO DO? INFLUENCE THE ELECTION. HELP HILLARY CLINTON WIN. INCLUDING DONNA BRAZILE LEAKING QUESTIONS TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. HOW ABOUT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THAT. LIBERALS IN THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN PUSHING THE IDEA THAT RUSSIA USED JULIAN ASAGE TO IMPACT THE ELECTION AND GAVE WIKILEAKS ACCESS TO JOHN PODESTA'S INBOX. ASAGE HAS SAID THAT RUSSIA DID NOT GIVE HIM THE E-MAILS AND WHEN I INTERVIEWED JULIAN ASAGE ON MY RADIO SHOW, HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS PUSHING A CONNECTION TO RUSSIA.  >> THE DEMOCRATS ALWAYS SPEAKING ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS. AND IT WAS IN MANY WAYS. BUT AT LEAST THE USSR EXISTED THEN AND THERE WERE RUSSIAN INFLUENCE CAMPAIGNS IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH WERE SERIOUS. WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN TRYING TO WHIP UP HIS STAIR YA WHERE SHE CLAIMS THAT EFFECTIVELY DONALD TRUMP IS AN AGENT TO THE RUSSIA RUSSIANS, THAT WIKILEAKS IS AN AGENT TO THE RUSSIANS. WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE. LET'S LOOK AT IT OBJECTIVELY. WE HAVE THE RULING PARTIES PREFERRED SUCCESSOR RUNNING AROUND CALLING THE OPPOSITION LEADER, IN FACT MULTIPLE OPPOSITION LEADERS AND THE CRITICAL PRESS FOREIGN AGENTS.  >> BY THE WAY, ISN'T THAT THE VERY --  >> TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE CLIMATE.  >> LET'S CONCEDE. JULIAN ASAGE IS A CONTROVERSIAL GUY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT HIM. SO LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE FOR NOW. WHAT ASAGE HAS DONE IS HE HAS EXPOSED TO AMERICA THAT WE HAVE A MAJOR CYBERSECURITY PROBLEM. OBAMA COULD HAVE FIXED THIS EIGHT YEARS AGO. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE NOTHING TO FIX. AND IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS ALONE, WELL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES LIKE THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE IRS, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE ALL BEEN HACKED AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. SO WHERE WAS THE OUTRAGE FROM OBAMA AND THE LEFT ON THAT. THERE WASN'T MUCH AND NOW THEY'RE UP IN ARMS OVER ALLEGATIONS OF HACKING BECAUSE THEY LOST AN ELECTION SO THEY WANT TO DELEGITIMIZE THE GUY THAT WON. LET'S KEEP IN MIND THAT WHILE DEMOCRATS FIRE UP THEIR FAKE MORAL OUTRAGE MACHINE, WHAT ARE WE GOING THE DO ABOUT IT NOW. HERE WITH REACTION, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR JOHN BOLTON. GOOD TO SEE YOU. THERE'S NO NEW INFORMATION. WE KNEW IT ALL AHEAD OF TIME. THE FBI AND CIA DISAGREE. WIKILEAKS GOES BACK TEN YEARS. THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO FIX -- HE HACKED INTO NASA AND THE D.O.D.

NOW WHEN YOU HAVE OBAMA SAYING LET'S HAVE A REPORT BY THE WAY BEFORE I LEAVE OFFICE ON THIS, IT MAKES ME NERVOUS, GIVEN OVER EIGHT YEARS OF PLIT ZAGS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.  >> FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE CIA -- I WANT TO MAKE A DISTINCTION. I LOVE OUR INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS. THE GUYS ON THE GROUND. THEY RISK THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND I LOVE THEM. OTHER OFFICIALS AT THE CI ACTION, THEY DID ALTER OFFICIALLY THE TALKING POINTS FOR BENGHAZI. THEY BOUGHT INTO A NARRATIVE. THEY NEVER TALKED TO THE GUYS ON THE GROUND IN BENGHAZI. THEY DID ALTER THE TALKING POINTS AND BUY INTO THE NARRATIVE THAT WAS FALSE AND JUST DECIDED SPONTANEOUSLY TO PULL THEM OUT.  >> I CAN'T UNDERLINE ENOUGH FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT HOW SHOCKED I WAS TO HEAR THE CIA WAS WRITING TALKING POINTS FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON THIS ISSUE TO BEGIN WITH. ONE THING TO SUPPLY THE INFORMATION. INTELLIGENCE IS NOT A BLOCK OF GRANITE. THERE ARE FACTS AND THEN THERE IS ANALYSIS. AND THE ANALYSIS IS OPEN TO INTERPRETATION BY ANYBODY WHO IS INVOLVED IN IT. MY CONCERN IS WHEN YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT, THE RISK OF POLITICALLY ZALIOLP.

THE REASON I'VE RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF A FALSE FLAG OPERATION, THAT IT WAS PEOPLE PLANTING EVIDENCE TO POINT THEIR FINGER AT RUSSIA, THERE MAY BE SOMEBODY ELSE WITH STAKES HERE. I HAVE NOT SAID IT WAS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT SAID THAT. I THINK IT WAS ANOTHER FOREIGN GOVERNMENT. NOBODY HAS EXPLAINED WHY THEY'RE SO CERTAIN IT'S THE RUSSIANS.  >> I HOPE YOU END UP SERVE IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. I THINK WOULD WOULD BE A REAL ASSET TO THE COUNTRY.

AND SO RATHER THAN COVERING THE NEW PRESIDENT -- LOOK HOW WELL TRUMP WAS RECEIVED AT THE ARMY-NAVY GAME. LOOK AT THE OUTPOURING OF AFFECTION AND INTHUS YACHL. IF YOU'RE THE PROPAGANDA MEDIA, THAT DRIVES YOU CRAZY AND YOU'VE GOT TO GRAB SOMETHING TO TRY TO SMEAR HIM SO THEY DO.  >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS EXPECT TO ME IT'S ABOUT DELEGITIMIZING TRUMP.

COMES DOWN TO THE HACKER'S INTENT AND WHETHER THERE'S STRONG EVIDENCE THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT GOT INVOLVED TO ENSURE A TRUMP VICTORY. AFTER THE U.S. PUBLICLY BLAMED RUSSIA IN OCTOBER, THE HACKS DROPPED OFF. PRESSED BY A SENIOR DEMOCRATIC. THE RUSSIAN LINKS TO DNC AND RELEASES BY WIKILEAKS WAS IN FACT MORE TENUOUS.  >> AS FAR AS THE WIKILEAKS CONNECTION, EVIDENCE THERE IS NOT STRONG AND WE DON'T HAVE GOOD INSIGHT INTO SEQUENCING OF RELEASES. OR WHEN THE DATA MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED.  >> THE FBI DIRECTOR HAD RESERVATIONS IN OCTOBER ABOUT PUBLICLY BLAMING RUSSIA. THEY HAVE UNTIL FRIDAY. TURNING NOW WITH MORE ON THIS, FORMER DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF FBI. THE CIA DIDN'T RELEASE THE STUFF PUBLICLY, BUT THE REPORTS CAME OUT THEY BELIEVE RUSSIA HAD THESE E-MAILS AND DONE SO TO P INTERFERE, HAD INTERFERED WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. NOW WE FIND OUT THE FBI IS NOT ON BOARD WITH THAT CONCLUSION AND THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SAYS LOOK, I CAN'T SAY THE CIA IS WRONG. ONLY THAT THEY CAN'T PROVE INTENT. SO DO YOU THINK SOME OF OUR FRIENDS IN THE MEDIA IN PARTICULAR GOT AHEAD OF THEIR SKIS SAYING RUSSIAN WANTED TRUMP TO BIN AND INTERFERED WITH THE ELECTION TO MAKE IT SO.  >> FIRST OFF, THIS HACKING IS A TERRIBLE THINGS. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR WHAT, DECADES, A LONG, LONG TIME. ALL OF MY GOVERNMENT RECORDS WERE DISCLOSED BY THE OPPOSITE MANAGEMENT. VERY WEAK SECURITY. OBVIOUSLY THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL DEHCOMMITTEE HAD WEAK SECURITY AND THE PLETHORA THAT ARE HACKED AND CONTINUE TO BE HACKED. WAS IT IS RUSSIANS, I DON'T KNOW. DOES IT SURPRISE ME THE FBI DOESN'T AGREE WITH THE AGENCY. NO. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR RELEASING THESE TYPES OF OPINIONS.  >> RIGHT.  >> THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL SECURITY, I THINK PROBABLY IS THE EXPLANATION POINT HERE, BUT WHETHER OR NOT I MEAN, I DON'T AGREE WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES INVOLVEDING THEMSELVES IN OUR ELECTIONS. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE, YOU KNOW, THE NOTION THAT THE RUSSIANS SWAYED THE ELECTION. HOW ABOUT THE FACT THE INFORMATION THAT WAS RELEASED MIGHT HAVE SWAYED IT. IN OTHER WORDS, THE MAJOR MEDIA WAS IN BED WITH THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE. JOHN PODESTA AND OTHERS WERE SENDING QUESTIONS OVER TO THE PRESS TO BE ANSWERED. THEY WERE PEOPLE HIRED BY THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO GO AND DISRUPT TRUMP EVENTS. THESE ARE MAYBE THE FACTS THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD AN OPINION WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE AND HOW THEY VOTED, BUT THE NOTION AND THE PUBLIC SHOULD UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT ABOUT HACKING INTO THE VOTING SYSTEMS PER SE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE ACTUAL TOTAL VOTES. WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE RUSSIANS PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE, BUT WHY WOULD -- THINK ABOUT THIS. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY DID OR NOT. WHY WOULD THE RUSSIANS PICK SOMEBODY WHO THE ODDS MAYBE HAD A 10% CHANCE OF WINNING THE ELECTION SGLS THE HACKS OCCURRED BACK IN SPRING OF 15. THEY DIDN'T KNOW DONALD TRUMP WAS GOING TO WITH THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE THEN. WHEN WERE THE E-MAILS LEAKED TO WIKILEAKS. THAT'S THE QUESTION. WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE SAYING. THESE ARE NOT REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC. WHAT THEY SEEM TO WITH SAYING. THERE WERE PERHAPS HACKS OF REPUBLICANS AS WELL. JOHN McCAIN SEEMED TO BE SUGGESTING THAT TODAY, BUT THE ONLY ONES THAT GOT GIVEN TO WIKILEAKS TO BE MADE PUBLIC WERE OF THE DEMS. AS YOU KNOW, WHILE THOSE LEAKS MADE THE DEMOCRATS LOOK TERRIBLE, WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE REPUBLICAN ONES? COULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS BAD. WHO THE HECK KNOWS.  \n",

      "JOINING US NOW. HOUSE TO HOUSE AND CHAIR INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. ALSO HERE DEMOCRATIC ANALYST JULIE. CONGRESSMAN, LET ME START WITH YOU. BOB GATES. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. JAMES BAKER. BOTH SAID THIS IS THE GUY. DO YOU THINK HIS TIES TO RUSSIA ARE GOING TO BE SO CONTROVERSIAL GIVEN THIS OTHER STORY ABOUT WHETHER RUSSIA INTERFERED TO HELP TRUMP WIN, YOU KNOW, NO ONE IS ALLEGING THAT TRUMP KNEW THAT. DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO DEFEAT HIM AND RUIN HIS CHANCES? WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW IS NUMBER ONE, THAT THIS WHOLE STORY ABOUT RUSSIA IS EVEN IN DISPUTE WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHERE THE DNI AND CIA ARE IN DISAGREEMENT. IT'S BEING DEFLATED.  >> THEY DON'T SAY THEY DISAGREE. THEY DON'T FEEL IT'S BEEN PROVEN. THEY CAN'T GET THERE.  >> YES. IT IS UNPROVEN IN LENGTH THAT THE CIA HAS MADE TO GET TO THAT STORY. ARE RATHER TENUOUS. SO THAT STORY IS GOING AWAY. WHAT REX TILLERSON DID IS EXACTLY WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO DO AS CEO OF GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY. CUT DEALS FOR BENEFIT OF SHAREHOLDER DEALERS, CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES THAT ENABLE COMPANY TO BE VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL AND DID THAT WITH PEOPLE LIKE PUTIN. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE HAS THE BACKGROUND AND THE BACKBONE TO STAND UP TO PUTIN IF HE'S OUR NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE.  >> THIS IS WHAT TRUMP REPORTEDLY PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP SAYS ABOUT HIM. HE'S A STRONG MAN. A TOUGH MAN. AND HE LIKES THAT ABOUT HIM. I THINK MOST OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW REX TILLERSON. LET'S JUST LISTEN TO HIM. HERE'S A SOUND BITE ABOUT HIM TALKING ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN.  >> I HAVE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. I DON'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE'S DOING. I DON'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING A LOT OF LEADERS ARE DOING, BUT HE UNDERSTANDS THAT I'M A BUSINESSMAN. AND I'VE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY. MY COMPANY HAS INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN RUSSIA VERY SUCCESSFULLY AND HE KNOWS US BEING THERE HAS CAUSED GOOD THINGS TO HAPPEN FOR THEM. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT'S -- I'M GOING TO COMPLY WITH THE SANCTIONS.  >> DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A BAD THING TO HAVE A SECRETARY OF STATE HAVING A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HEAD OF RUSSIA.  >> REX TILLERSON IS A VERY EASY ANSWER TO GIVE. DOES HE OR DOES HE NOT SUPPORT SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. HE DIDN'T SUPPORT THEM IN THE PAST. BECAUSE HIS COMPANY WAS LOSING TONS OF MONEY AS A RESULT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO DRILL IN THE ARCTIC.  >> AND HE SAID THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE UNLESS THEIR COMPREHENSIVE.  >> LISTEN, NOBODY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA THAN ME. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HIM EXPAND ON THAT AS WELL. SECONDLY, IT IS IN HIS PERSONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST FOR SANCTIONS TO BE LIFTED. PENSION FUND DEPENDS ON THE SHARES OF EXXON GOING UP. IF HE CONTINUES TO CUT DEALS, VLADIMIR PUTIN AND HIS CRONIES RUN THAT MASK RAID WITH THE RUSSIAN OIL COMPANY.  >> I HADN'T HEARD ANYBODY RAISE THAT. CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT, PETE, ABOUT THE VALUE OF HIS RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.  >> I THINK THERE'S A VERY EASY THING FOR REX TILLERSON TO CUT HIS TIES TO HIS PENSION TO TAKE THE CASH OUT AND MAKE SURE IT GOES INTO A BLIND TRUST. YOU CAN CUT THESE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEED A NEW STRATE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH RUSSIA FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS DOESN'T WORK. WE HAVE TO EXECUTE THE RESET BUTTON THAT HILLARY CLINTON PROPOSED ON 2009.  >> LET ME JUST SAY THIS CONGRESSMAN. THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT'S INVADED UKRAINE. SEIZED A GREAT CHUNK OF THEIR LAND. THAT STILL HAS SOLDIERS DESPITE THEIR DENIALS. THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT THAT AMONG THE INTELLIGENT AGENCIES THEY'VE HACKED THEY'RE ONLY DISAGREEING THEY WERE DOING IT TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP.

      "TONIGHT, PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP CONTINUES HIS THANK YOU TOUR. WE'LL HAVE HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU LATER IN THE SHOW. BUT FIRST, SORE LOSER DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO PUSH THE IDEA THAT RUSSIA HELPED THE REPUBLICANS WIN THE ELECTION. THAT'S TONIGHT'S OPEN MONOLOGUE. LIBERALS KEEP PLAYING UP THE NARRATIVE THAT RUSSIA HAS HACKED AND HELPED DONALD TRUMP WITH HIS ELECTORAL VICTORY OVER HILLARY CLINTON DESPITE CONFLICTING VIEWS ON THE ISSUE OF INTELLIGENCE FROM THE CIA AND THE FBI. NOW THE LEFT WING IS RUNNING WILD WITH REPORTS SAYING THAT THE CIA WITHOUT CONCRETE OR NEW EVIDENCE, THEY THINK NOW THAT RUSSIAN HACKERS INFLUENCED THE ELECTION ALL IN FAVOR OF DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S A CONSPIRACY. NOW DEMOCRATS AND THE ABUSIVELY BIASSED ALT-LEFT MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS PUSHING THE CIA'S ASSESSMENT AS AN UNDENIABLE FACT. YOU NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH. IT IS NOT. THE FBI HAS REACHED A MUCH DIFFERENT CONCLUSION THAN THE CIA BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT FOUND CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIA WAS TRYING TO ASSIST DONALD TRUMP IN ANY WAY. REUTERS IS REPORTING THAT AMERICA'S TOP SPY AGENCY, THE OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IS NOT EMBRACING THE CIA'S CONCLUSIONS EITHER. WHY? THERE'S A LACK OF EVIDENCE. INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING THE FACTS ON ALL OF THIS AND TELLING YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE TRUTH, THE LEFT, LED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, CONTINUE TO REPEAT FALSE HOODS. MOTIVE? TO DELEGITIMIZE PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP. NOW FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA HE'S DOES A FLIP-FLOP ON THE POTENTIAL OF THE ELECTION IN AMERICA BEING INTERFERED WITH. YOU MAY REMEMBER BACK IN OCTOBER, THIS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA MOCKING DONALD TRUMP FOR RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT FAIRNESS IN AN ELECTION. WATCH THIS.  >> THE LARGER POINT THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE HERE IS THAT THERE IS NO SERIOUS PERSON OUT THERE WHO WOULD SUGGEST SOMEHOW THAT YOU COULD EVEN -- YOU COULD EVEN RIG AMERICA'S ELECTIONS. AND SO I'D ADVISE MR. TRUMP TO STOP WHINING AND GO MAKE A CASE TO GET VOTES.  >> WHO'S WHINING NOW. SO ONLY AFTER DONALD TRUMP WON, WELL NOW PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYING THAT YES, OUTSIDE FORCES COULD HAVE INFLUENCED THE ELECTION. TAKE A LOOK AT THE HYPOCRISY FROM THE PRESIDENT. THIS WAS ON \"THE DAILY SHOW\" LAST NIGHT.  >> RUSSIA TRYING TO INFLUENCE OR ELECTIONS DATES BACK TO THE SOVIET UNION. WHAT THEY DID HERE, HACKING SOME E-MAILS AND RELEASING THEM IS NOT A PARTICULARLY FANCY BRAND OF ESPIONAGE OR PROPAGANDA. WE WERE, FRANKLY, MORE CONCERNED IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION TO THE POSSIBILITY OF VOTE TAMPERING WHICH WE DID NOT SEE EVIDENCE OF AND WERE CONFIDENT THAT WE COULD GUARD AGAINST.  >> REMEMBER LAST WEEK I SAID THEY WERE NOT YOUR FRIENDS. OBAMA IS NOT DONALD TRUMP'S FRIEND. IN THE SAME ENTIRE VIEW PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK THE IT FURTHER BY ALLEGING THAT PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP HAS DIRECT TIES TO RUSSIA. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. YOU HAD WHAT WAS VERY CLEAR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT'S CAMPAIGN TEAM AND RUSSIANS. AND A PROFESSED SHARED VIEW ON A BUNCH OF ISSUES.  >> NOW WHEN IT COMES TO WORKING WITH THE RUSSIANS, PRESIDENT OBAMA CLEARLY HAS A PRETTY SHORT MEMORY. YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS CAUGHT ON A HOT MIKE SAYING THIS TO THE PRIME MINISTER DIMITRI MED DA VA BACK IN 2012.  \n",

      ">> AFTER MY ELECTION I HAVE -- [ INAUDIBLE ]  >> AS LONG AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE OF INTERFERING IN ELECTIONS, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION KNOW A LOT ABOUT THAT TOO. REMEMBER THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION THEY FOUND BACK IN 2014 AN ISRAELI POLITICAL GROUP USED$300,000 OBAMA GRANT TO TRY TO DEFEAT BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. PRESIDENT OBAMA PRETENDS TO BE OUTRAGED OVER THE HACKING AND OUTRAGE, HE'S DONE NEXT TO NOTHING ON CYBERSECURITY IN THE ENTIRE EIGHT YEARS HE'S BEEN PRESIDENT. SINCE 2012 HACKERS HAVE ATTACKED NASA, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, THE FEC COMMISSION NETWORKS, THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE, THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION, THEY'VE HACKED THE WHITE HOUSE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE IRS AND THE OFFICE OF PERSONAL MANAGEMENT. NOW THE WHOLE ELECTION CYCLE WAS ALL ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS, WIKILEAKS. SO WHERE WAS THE HACKING OUTRAGE BEFORE SHE LOST? NOW ON THIS SHOW WE HAVE BEEN WARNING THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE, WHICH IS WHY I'VE BEEN SAYING AND CRITICIZED OFTEN WHEN SAYING THAT WE NEED TO LEARN FROM JULIAN ASAGE AND WIKILEAKS AND ACTUALLY TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM. HE HACKED INTO NASA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BEFORE HE WAS 16 YEARS OLD. HERE'S THE TRUTH THAT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER. THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT HACKING. ALL HE CARES ABOUT AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF DOING NOTHING IS TO UNDERMINE' DELEGITIMIZE DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. IF THEY CARED ABOUT HACKING, WE'VE KNOWN THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT HACKING. THIS IS ABOUT POLITICS. DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE?  >> TOTALLY AGREE. IF HILLARY HAD WON THE ELECTION, WE WOULD NEVER HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THIS AGAIN. THEY WOULD MOVE ON TO THE CAUSE OF THE MOMENT OF THE DAY. REMEMBER WHEN WE LEARNED THAT THE CHINESE HAS HACKED INTO 50 MILLION U.S. PERSONNEL FILES, INCLUDING MINE -- AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I GOT A NOTICE FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SAYING THAT THEY WOULD GIVE ME, I THINK, A YEAR OF SOME TYPE OF IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION SERVICE BECAUSE THEY HAD MY BACKGROUND CHECK --  >> PROBABLY YOURS TOO.  >> THEY HAD A COPY OF MY BACKGROUND CHECK FOR WHEN I WAS A WHITE HOUSE EMPLOYEE OR SUPREME COURT CLERK. ONE OF THE TWO. I DON'T REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA TAKING CHINA TO TASK. THEY HAVE ALL OF OUR SIBLINGS, ALL OF THE PLACES WHERE WE EVER LIVED OF 50 MILLION GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES N EMPLOYEES. THAT'S CHINA. SO YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE MONEY ON THIS. THIS IS ALL ABOUT SOUR GRAPES AND TRYING TO DELEGITIMIZE THE TRUMP VICTORY AND ALSO I THINK TRY TO SUBTRACT FROM ANY MANDATE THAT HE BELIEVES HE HAS TO REFORM THE GOVERNMENT. THEY NEVER CHANGE THEIR IDEAS ABOUT POLICIES. THEY JUST MOVE THEIR LINES OF ATTACK, WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.  >> IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE OBAMA DID GO ON \"60 MINUTES\" AND EXONERATE HILLARY CLINTON OTHER THE E-MAILS SCANDAL. IT'S NO DBIG DEAL. NOW WE'VE LEARNED THAT FIVE AGENCIES WERE ABLE TO GET TOP SECRET INFORMATION. SO HE WAS WRONG THERE. NOR DID HE SEEM TO CARE. SO I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THIS IS POLITICS. HERE'S MY NEXT QUESTION. FIRST THEY TRIED THE RECOUNT. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR THEM. NOW THEY'RE TRYING THE HACKING. BUT BEHIND THE SCENES IT SEEMS THAT OBAMA AND CLINTON SURROGATES HAVE THEIR FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE EFFORT TO TRY TO GET THEM TO SWITCH THEIR VOTES.

WHY SHOULDN'T THE CLINTON ELECTORS GET A BRIEFING AS TO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DESCRIBED IN YOUR MONOLOGUE, THE BREACHES IN THE SYSTEM, THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY, THE MISREPRESENTATION. THEY SHOULD GET THAT BRIEFING. IF THE TRUMP PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET ANOTHER TYPE OF BRIEFING, LET'S MAKE IT FAIR. IS THIS GOING TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME? I DOUBT IT. A LOT IS ABOUT FEEDING THE BEAST OF THE ACTIVIST GROUPS THAT ARE ANCY AND ANGRY ON THE LEFT. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE FOR CLINTON. THEY WERE SUSPICIOUS OF MRS. CLINTON FOR HER TIES. AND NOW THEY'RE MAD. THEY NEED SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN. THEY NEED SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO. I THINK THIS IS MUCH ABOUT GETTING E-MAIL ADDRESSES AND RAISES MONEY FOR THE NEXT ELECTORAL PUSH AS IT IS ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.  >> LET ME ASK YOU THIS. EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION THAT WE'RE HEARING WE ALL KNEW BEFORE THE ELECTION. THERE'S NOTHING NEW HERE. NOW THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CLAPPER, THE FBI DIRECTOR AND THE FBI ITSELF, THEY'VE COME TO VERY DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THIS. THERE'S NOTHING NEW HERE SO THEN THAT RAISES QUESTIONS, WHY IS THE MEDIA AND WHY IS HILLARY CLINTON WHO WARNED THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN'T DO THIS, THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED, YOU CAN'T CHALLENGE AN ELECTION LIKE THIS, THAT'S NOT HOW OUR SYSTEM WORKS, HOW DOES SHE JUSTIFY BEING A PART OF ALL OF THESE EFFORTS?  >> I THINK IT'S RICH FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO TELL US THAT'S NOT HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS WHEN THAT'S THE WAY SHE RAN THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE USE OF CONSULTANTS WHO ARE ALSO ON THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL. ALL OF THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DONE. SO WHETHER DONALD TRUMP DECIDES, I GUESS, NOT TO PURSUE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION OR NOT, WE NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.  >> THAT'S NOT HIS CALL. WOULDN'T THAT BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S CALL?  >> I THINK IT WOULD BE. BUT WHATEVER SIGNAL TRUMP GIVES IS GOING TO HAVE SOME INFLUENCE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO RUN ACROSS THE BOARD TO ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR LAST NAME WAS OR WHERE THEY CAME FROM. AND IF THERE WAS REAL POTENTIAL FOR CRIMINALITY, PROBABLE CAUSE FOR CRIMINALITY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.  >> THE OBAMA HAS A HISTORY OF MANIPULATING FOR GAIN. BUT DIDN'T THE CIA WRITE OR REWRITE THE TALKING POINTS AS IT ALL RELATED TO BENGHAZI FOR HAVING NEVER SPOKEN TO ANYBODY ON THE GROUND, THEY MANUFACTURED IT? AND I'M NOT CRITICIZING OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCY BUT THERE ARE SOME POLITICAL AGENTS THERE THAT WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THIS WAS A SPONTANEOUS ATTACK WHERE PEOPLE HAD RPGs AND MORTARS IN THEIR BACK POCKET AND SPONTANEOUSLY PULLED THEM OUT AND ATTACKED THE AGENCY, WHICH NEVER HAPPENED.  >> THERE WAS POLITICIZED INTELLIGENCE PUT OUT TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. THERE ARE SUCH NOBLE HEROIC EFFORTS ON THE PART OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. SO MANY GOOD MEN AND WOMEN PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. WE DON'T WANT TO CAST ASPERSIONS ON THEM.

THE ELECTION TOOK A COUPLE OF EXPLOSIVE TURNS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. FIRST, THE REPUBLICANS STARTED QUESTIONING WHY THEY WERE SEEING MEDIA STORIES OF RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT THAT WENT WELL BEYOND WHAT THEY HAD BEEN TOLD BY THESE AGENCIES. THEN THE HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE DEMANNED AN EMERGENCY HEARING WITH THE CIA, FBI, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. NOW TONIGHT JUST HOURS AGO REPUBLICANS FORCED TO CANCEL THAT HEARING WHEN THE INTEL AGENCIES REFUSED TO COOPERATE. SAYING THEY WOULD NOT BE SENDING ANY BRIEFERS IN.

CATHERINE?  >> LATE TODAY THE REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ISSUING THIS STATEMENT AFTER THE CIA SAID THE AGENCY WOULD NOT SEND A BRIEFER TO CAPITOL HILL TO DEBRIEF ABOUT RUSSIA'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE ELECTION.

THE COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS AND WILL INSIST -- THE CIA TOLD THE HOUSE COMMITTEE IT WAS TOO BUSY WITH THE PRESIDENT'S REVIEW TO HELP.

ALL WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS IS THAT THEY COULD NOT SAY THAT THERE WAS ANY ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE HILLARY CLINTON TO HELP DONALD TRUMP. THE CONSENSUS WAS WAS THAT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT BY RUSSIANS TO PUT THE CLOUD OVER THE ELECTION. TO CREATE THIS UNITY. THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. AS THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS DOING IT, NOTHING AT ALL EVER TOLD TO US. THEY SAID, THEY COULDN'T PROVE IT, THAT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO FAVOR ONE CANDIDATE OVER THE OTHER. DIRECTOR CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SAID THAT PUBLICLY ON NOVEMBER 17th. NOW WE HAVE, AS FAR AS I KNOW, THERE IS NO DECISION BY THE CIA. THERE IS NO CONSENSUS OPINION. YET WE FIND IT IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES,\" IN THE WASHINGTON POST AND YET THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE IS TOLD NOTHING ABOUT THIS. AND YET IT'S OUR COMMITTEE, NUNEZ, WHO IS OVER THE AGENCY.

THAT'S THE FIRST YOU HEARD OF IT FROM THE WASHINGTON POST. NOW THIS WOULD BE YOUR NEXT AND BEST ATTEMPT TO GET THE CIA TO COME BEFORE YOU AND HAVE YOU OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY OVER THEM AND THEY REFUSE?  >> THEY ABSOLUTELY REFUSE.

YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT?  >> NO. IT'S THEIR JOB TO COME. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE. THEY HAVE TO COME IN. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE CREATED THIS, THE WEEK BEFORE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS MEETING --  >> WHAT ARE THEY DOING? IT IS TOUGH TO BELIEVE THEY DON'T HAVE TIME. IT IS A BIG AGENCY. THEY CAN'T HAVE ONE PERSON TO GO TO CONGRESS WHO REPRESENTS US FOR OVERSIGHT PURPOSES? WHY WOULD THEY PLAY THIS GAME AND REFUSE TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU?  >> FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY CONCLUSION THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO FAVOR DONALD TRUMP OVER HILLARY CLINTON. WHO IS THE CIA? WHEN THEY SAY THE CIA MADE THIS CONCLUSION, WHO? IS THAT BRENNAN? WHO IN THE CIA HAS DONE THIS? THERE IS NO FINDING AND NO ASSESSMENT THAT WE'VE SEEN. IF THEY HAD, THEY HAD AN OBLIGATION TO SHOW IT TO US. MAYBE THERE IS NONE. THIS COULD BE A WHOLE HOUSE OF CARDS. I FIND THIS DISINFORMATION TO DISCREDIT THE INCOMING PRESIDENT-ELECT.  >> THAT'S QUITE AN ACCUSATION. THESE ARE SPIES WHO RISK THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT US, I MEAN, THAT THAT'S -- GENERAL HAYDEN WAS OUT YESTERDAY SAYING THIS KIND OF THING, THESE GUYS PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. WLAE SA WHAT HE SAID, CIA DIRECTOR SAID THEY ARE ARE IN HARM'S WAY TO FIND OUT THINGS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNAVAILABLE. BY WHAT MORAL AUTHORITY DOES A DIRECTOR PUT HIS PEOPLE AT RISK. THAT'S FORMER HEAD OF CIA. DO YOU GO TOO FAR OF INTENTIONALLY -- IN A CAMPAIGN.  >> THAT'S THEIR OBLIGATION. WHY TELL THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, IF SOMETHING SO DRAMATIC HAPPENED BETWEEN NOVEMBER 17th AND THIS WEEK TO CHANGE THEIR ASSESSMENT, DIDN'T THEY HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO COME BEFORE THE CONGRESS AND TELL US THAT? WE'RE THE ONES WITH JURISDICTION. NUNEZ IS THE ONE THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE TOO. SOMEONE. OR AGAIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION DO THAT. AND TO COME OUT WITH THIS AND SAY THE CIA HAS THIS AND NO ONE IN THE CIA IS SPEAKING, NO ONE ON THE RECORD, SO IF IT IS TRUE, THEY ARE LAEBLGING IT. THAENTS A CRIME. IF SOMEBODY IS MAKING IT UP THAT'S ALSO -- THIS STINKS. IT IS WRONG AND LISTEN, THIS COULD WELL BE THE CONCLUSION SOMETIMES. IF IT IS, THEY HAVE TO DO IT IN A PROPER WAY. IT.

PROFESSOR LESSIC OFFERED NO EVIDENCE TO BACK UP HIS CLAIM WHICH IS BEING DIRECTLY CONTRADICTED BY THE STATE GOP COMMITTEES WHO SAY THAT ONLY ONE GOP ELECTOR, FROM TEXAS, REVEALED HIS INTENTION TO VOTE AGAINST TRUMP.

AND THESE HIGH-TECH BILLIONS HAVE A LOT OF STAKE IN THE TRUMP ALSO BECAUSE THEY HAVE BILLIONS STASHED OVERSEAS. HE DOESN'T WANT IT PAY HIGH TAXES ON THEM.

TOP PICK FOR AGRICULTURE RIGHT NOW IS DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA, BUT SHE IS GETTING HER ARMS TWISTED AND PERHAPS BEING THREATENED WITH KNEECAPPING BY A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WHO SAY IF YOU TAKE THIS JOB IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO PUT A REPUBLICAN IN YOUR PLACE. SO SHE MIGHT NOT TAKE IT. SECOND PICK IS THE CONGRESSWOMAN FROM SOUTH DAKOTA, BUT SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T WANT THE JOB. VETERANS AFFAIRS IS PROVING TO BE PARTICULARLY THORNY. THEY DON'T YET HAVE A REALLY STRONG CANDIDATE. WE MIGHT NOT HEAR ABOUT THESE MEGYN FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS OR EVEN COUPLE OF WEEKS.  >> THANK YOU. WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING SO FAR FROM TEAM TRUMP ABOUT THE FIGHT FROM LEADERS AND INTEL AGENCIES SUGGESTING THERE IS RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION TO BENEFIT DONALD TRUMP. BUT FORTUNATELY WE HAVE KELLYANNE CONWAY WITH US TONIGHT SO WE CAN ASK HER LIVE. GREAT TO SEE YOU.  >> THANK YOU, MEGYN.  >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT CIA AND OTHER SPY AGENCIES THUMBED THEIR NOSE AT CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT LEADERS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE FOR US TO KEEP AN EYE ON THEM WHEN IT COME TO THE LEAK FROM THE WASHINGTON POST ON FRIDAY.  >> WE SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. YOU ADD CLOSED DOOR HOUSE INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING AND NO SOONER DID PEOPLE WALK OUT THAN APPARENTLY SOME FOLKS WERE TALK TO THE MEDIA. MAYBE NOT IN THIS INSTANCE BUT AT SOME POINT IT COULD PUT ALL OF US AT RISK. FOR WHAT PURPOSE? TO POLITICIZE OR CARRY FAVOR WITH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA? NONE OF THAT IS WORTH LEAKING SECRETS.  >> THIS IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO WITH CONGRESSMAN --  >> YES.  >> THE MOWING THAT CIA IS DOING ANYTHING OTHER THAN WORKING TO PROTECT US WOULD SOUND VERY FOREIGN NOTE OF PEOPLE.  >> I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT.  >> YOU DO YOU THINK THEY ARE POLITICIZING THIS?  >> NO. I THINK PEOPLE THAT WANT THIS TO BE THE PERMANENT CAMPAIGN, THE ELECTION DENIERS, AND A WHOLE GROUP OF THEM. NOT JUST TEAM HILLARY, BUT A GROUP THAT NEVER CONCEIVED THE POSSIBLE THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE THEIR PRESIDENT AND HE HAS BEEN FOR 35 DAYS NOW, THEY ARE POLITICIZING IT. I BELIEVE AS PRESIDENT-ELECT SAID WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY OPINION, HE HAS GREAT FAITH IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE, IF YOU READ SOME OF THESE NEWS ACCOUNTS IN MAINSTREAM PAPERS WHERE PEOPLE ARE READING SOMETHING SAYING IT MUST BE TRUE, I JUST READ FIVE PARAGRAPHS STRONG WHERE IT IS AN OUTRIGHT ASSERTION THAT RUSSIA CHANGES THE ELECTION RESULT, THAT IS JUST NOT PROVEN, NOT FALSE AND DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY. I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID ON LIVE TELEVISION AT THE LAST DEBATE IN LAS VEGAS ON NOVEMBER 19 AND WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID I WILL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE WHETHER I WILL ACCEPT ELECTION RESULT, SHE SHOT BACK SAYING THIS IS SCARY.  \n",

NEXT IS DR. SEBASTIAN GORKGORKA. WHAT IS THE CORE ALLEGATION HERE?  >> THE CORE ALLEGATION IS THAT RUSSIA AS A STATE WAS SOMEHOW LINKED TO THE LEAKING OF THE PODESTA E-MAILS OPEN THAT IS A BAD THING, THAT SOMEHOW PROFITED THE WINNER OF THE ELECTION. BUT THERE'S A REAL BIG FLAW WITH THAT ALLEGATION, TUCKER. ARE THE PODESTA E-MAILS TRUE OR ARE THEY MANUFACTURED FAKES. IF THEY'RE REAL, RELEASING THEM IS NAUGHTY BUT WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT PODESTA UNDERMINED IF DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, THAT THEY WERE TAKING OUT BERNIE SANDERS, THAT THEY WERE SAYING NASTY THINGS ABOUT CATHOLIC. IF THIS IS TRUE -- OF COURSE IT ISN'T. WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE INTENT. BUT THEY MADE THE ELECTORATE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE. IS THAT A BAD THING?  >> THAT'S THE QUESTION. ARE THESE A FORGERY OR ARE THEY THE PENTAGON PAPERS, SOMETHING THAT THE AMERICAN CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE.  >> EITHER WE THANK THE RUSSIANS FOR HELPING US GET INFORMATION.  >> I ALSO WONDER YOU SPENT A LOT OF TAME IN YEEEASTERN EUROPE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE RUSSIANS THOUGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS GOING TO WIN?  >> WHO KNEW WHO WAS GOING TO WIN. LOOK AT BREXIT. WHO GOT BREXIT RIGHT. NOBODY GOT BREXIT RIGHT.  >> THE BETTING MARKETS GOT IT WRONG.  >> \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" -- \"HUFFINGTON POST\" SAID HILLARY CLINTON HAS A 92% VICTORY BEFORE THE ELECTION. NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. WHY? BECAUSE THEY WERE LISTENING TO WHAT. THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA. THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA ECHO CHAMBER.

      "BREAKING TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA NOW VOWING TO QUOTE TAKE ACTION AGAINST RUSSIA FOR INTERFERE IN THE UNITED STATES ELECTION ALLEGEDLY. A THREAT THAT COMES JUST HOURS AFTER REPORTS THAT HE WAS WELL AWARE OF RUSSIA'S ROLE MONTHS AGO BUT KEPT THE INFORMATION QUIET BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HILLARY CLINTON WAS GOING TO WIN. WELCOME TO \"THE KELLY FILE.\" I'M MEGYN KELLY. IT'S BELIEVED THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF RUSSIA'S CYBER MILITIAS DATING BACK TO THE SUMMER OF 2015. AND TONIGHT THE REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID NOT SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE FOLKS THOUGHT THAT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD WIN THE ELECTION AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO START A CYBER WAR WITH RUSSIA. THIS FOLLOWS A STRING OF WHITE HOUSE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP WITH THE PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST CLAIMING THAT NOT ONLY DID CANDIDATE TRUMP KNOW THAT RUSSIA WAS ENGAGING IN CYBER ACTIVITY, HE ENCOURAGED IT. WELL THEY APPARENTLY KNEW TOO AND HIS BOSS WAS THE SITTING PRESIDENT. KELLYANNE CONWAY IS CALLING THE CHARGES AGAINST HER BOSS BREATHTAKING.  >> THAT IS BREATHTAKING. I GUESS HE'S AUDITIONING TO BE A POLITICAL PUNDIT. THAT IS INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTINGS TO HEAR FROM THE PODIUM OF THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY. HE ESSENTIALLY STATED THAT THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAD KNOWLEDGE OF IT, MAYBE EVEN FANNED THE FLAMES. IT'S INCREDIBLY IRRESPONSIBLE.  >> WE'LL HAVE REACTION FROM CONGRESSMAN JOHN KING AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL TONY SCHAFER. BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OUR CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT KATHERI KATHERI KATHERI KATHERINE H KATHERINE HER RIJ. THIS WAS AN EFFORT TO INTERFERE IN THE U.S. ELECTION. THESE OPERATIONS WERE SAME-SENCD BY THE HIGHEST LEVELS. A GOVERNMENT SOURCE SAYS THERE WAS A RELUCTANCE TO FURTHER INSERT GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR ASSESSMENTS INTO A DEEPLY POLITICIZED ELECTION CYCLE. A LEADING EXPERT SAYS THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY REVIEWED THE TECHNIQUES, TACTICS AND PROCEDURES LEVERAGED IN THE ATTACKS AND MADE THE LINK TO RUSSIA. IN OCTOBER THE AGENCIES OR HOME LAND SECURITY WENT ON THE RECORD. THOUGH PUTIN WAS NOT MENTIONED BY NAME.  >> THIS IS A STATEMENT THAT WAS WRITTEN BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. YOU SHOULD ASK THEM WHAT THEIR INTENT WAS. BUT MY READING OF IT WAS THAT IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE SUBTLE.  >> TONIGHT THE SENIOR DEMOCRAT SAID THE SOURCES WERE HIGHLY CREDIBLE. SENATOR FEINSTEIN SAYS SHE BELIEVES THAT THE RUSSIANS ENGAGED IN A COVERT CAMPAIGN TO INFLUENCE AMERICAN OPINION. CURRENT AND FORMER INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS SAY LANGUAGE REALLY MATTERS HERE AND THERE IS A BIG GAP BETWEEN RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED HACKING AND THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PERSONALLY DIRECTING AND DICTATING HOW E-MAILS WERE RELEASED.  >> JOINING ME NOW WITH MORE, PETER KING, MEMBER OF THE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL TONY SCHAFER, A CIA SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. CONGRESSMAN KING WITHIN YOU W, WERE ON THE PROGRAM LAST NIGHT IN DISBELIEF THAT THE CIA HAD BLOWN OFF CONGRESS AND EXMAIN WHAT THEY MET HERE. AND TODAY YOU WENT TO TRUMP TOWER AND MET WITH THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. WHAT'S THE LATEST?  >> I DISCUSSED WITH HIM WHAT I SAID ON YOUR SHOW LAST NIGHT, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS NEVER SHOWN US ANYTHING INDICATING THAT THE RUSSIANS, WHO I BELIEVE WERE INVOLVED IN HACKING, THAT THEY WERE ATTEMPTING TO FAVOR DONALD TRUMP OVER HILLARY CLINTON. THEY'VE CONSISTENTLY TOLD US THAT THE INTENTION OF THE RUSSIANS WAS TO DISRUPT THE ELECTION AND PUT A CLOUD OVER WHOEVER WON THE ELECTION. THEY'RE SUCCEEDING IN THAT. BUT AS FAR AS THE REPORTS OVER THE WEEKEND, THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT. NOTHING TO BACK THAT UP AT ALL. NO --  \n",

IT'S LIKE SOMEONE IS TAKING SID SIDES.  >> THE NOTION THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS NOW SAYING IT WAS THE RUSSIANS AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ACTION. WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION. IT'S LIKE, WELL, YOU'VE KNOWN SINCE THE SUMMER OF '15 AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS, WHAT KIND OF ACTION? LIKE REDLINE ACTION AND SYRIA ACTION? IT'S TOUGH TO TAKE THAT KIND OF THREAT SERIOUSLY GIVEN HIS PAST FAILURE TO FOLLOW THROUGH IN MUCH MORE SERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.  >> I'M STILL SKEPTICAL. THERE'S NO NEW EVIDENCE. JAMES CLAPPER PUT OUT --  >> AND EVEN HE SAID THAT. HE SAID, I DON'T THINK THEY GOT IT.  >> HE'S AN OPERATIVE WHO'S RUN THESE SORTS OF OPERATIONS. I'VE HAD TO NOTIFY THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL IN CERTAIN OPERATIONS, BRIEF THE WHITE HOUSE ON THINGS I'M DOING. THINGS GET POLITICIZED AT THAT LEVEL ALL OF THE TIME. NO OTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IS BACKING UP THE CIA ON THIS. IF THAT EVIDENCE IS THERE, PRESIDENT OBAMA OWES THIS NATION LIKE PRESIDENT REAGAN DID ON THE 007 DOWNING THAT THE RUSSIANS DID BACK IN THE '80s WHEN AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAD TO HAVE PICTURES AT THE U.N. SHOWING THE RUSSIAN MISSILES IN CUBA. THAT'S WHAT IS NEEDED FOR THE PRESIDENT TO COME BACK WITH THIS SEVERE BELIEF IN RESPONSE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S AVAILABLE BY THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO NEW INFORMATION.  >> HERE'S THE QUESTION. I'LL PUT IT TO YOU, CONGRESSMAN KING. IN THE CIA'S DEFENSE THEY SAY YOU CAN DRAW THE INFERENCE BECAUSE ALL OF THE STUFF THAT CAME OUT HURT HILLARY AND NOT DONALD TRUMP. THERE WERE REPORTEDLY SOME HACKS OF SOME REPUBLICANS AND YET WE NEVER SAW THOSE DOCUMENTS. ALL WE SAW WAS PODESTA STUFF AND DNC STUFF. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO SAY WHY WOULD THEY RELEASE THAT AND NOT THE STUFF FROM THE REPUBLICANS.  >> WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE INVOLVED WITH PODESTA. AND GENERAL CLAPPER SAID THAT T CERTAIN WHERE THAT CAME FROM. NUMBER TWO WOULD BE AS FAR AS THE MOTIVE. ALL ALONG THEY'VE BEEN TELLING US THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVE IS. YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE INFERENCES. BUT THE CIA UP UNTIL NOVEMBER 17th, WE HEARD NOTHING OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW. WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN NOVEMBER 17th AND NOW THAT CAUSED THE CIA TO CHANGE THEIR OPINION. THEY COULD HAVE MADE THESE SAME INPHYSICIA INFERENCES BACK IN OCTOBER. THE RECENT CIA REPORT -- I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS AT THE CIA, JOHN BRENNAN? NO ONE IS ON THE RECORD.  >> AND THEY WON'T SPEAK TO YOU.  >> UNHEARD OF. IT'S WRONG. IN THE PAST THEY CAME UP WITH A REPORT THAT WE DISAGREE WITH, THAT'S FAIR GAME. BUT THERE IS NOTHING. SHADOW BOXING.  >> WHY WOULD THE CIA BE PLAYING PEEK A BOO WITH THE FACT?  >> THEY'RE TRYING TO INSERT THEMSELVES INTO DEMOCRAT POLITICS. MEGYN, THE RAZOR SHOULD APPLY HERE. JULIAN ASAGE SAID WHERE THIS CAME FROM, AN INSIDER.  >> THAT IS THE SIMPLEST THEORY IS RIGHT ONE.  >> MAYBE THE SIMPLEST THEORY IS THAT SOMEONE INSIDE THE DNC DID GIVE ALL OF THE E-MAILS TO ASAGE. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT OTHERS ON OUR SIDE HAVE BEEN UPSET, FORMER MEMBERS OF NSA HAVE DONE THINGS TO ASSIST. MAYBE WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS CLOSER TO HOME. JOHN BRENNAN IS ACTING POLITICALLY AND HE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. NO ONE ELSE IS TRYING TO DO WHAT HE IS DOING WHICH IS UNDERMINING THE ELECTION.  \n",

I DON'T THINK WE'RE EVER GOING TO HAVE TO USE IT AND THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY NICE. AMERICA FIRST. BE VERY VERY NICE. MY ADMINISTRATION WILL FOCUS SQUARELY ON THE VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES. AND THAT MEANS CRUSHING ISIS AND DEFEATING RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. WE'RE GOING TO DEFEAT IT QUICKLY. BUT TO BE A STRONG NATION, WE MUST ALSO BE A WEALTHY OR A RICH NATION. SOME PEOPLE SAY, MR. TRUMP, NOW THEY SAY MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? JUST CALL ME DONALD, FOLKS. JUST CALL ME DONALD. BUT THEY SAY MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT, IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD WHEN YOU SAY RICH NATION.

NOW HE TWEETED EARLIER TO TODAY, IN RUSSIA OR SOME OTHER ENTITY WAS HACKING, WHY DID THE WHITE HOUSE ACT TO LONG TO REACT. CONGRESSMAN PETE KING THINKS SOME IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY MAY BE TRYING TO UNDERMINE PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP. ALL WE'VE HEARD FROM THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS IS THEY COULD NOT SAY THERE WAS ANY ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE HILLARY CLINTON TO HELP DONALD TRUMP. THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL EVER TOLD TO US -- IN FACT THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T PROVE IT, THAT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO FAVOR ONE CANDIDATE OVER THE OTHER. DIRECTOR CLAPPER SAID THAT PUBLICLY ON NOVEMBER 17th. IT'S ALMOST AS IF PEOPLE IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ARE CARRYING OUT AN INFORMATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT'S DISGRACEFUL. AND IF THEY'RE NOT DOING IT, THEN IT MUST BE SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE OR THE SENATE WHO'S LEAKING FALSE INFORMATION. AND THERE SHOULD BE A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THIS.  >> HERE WITH US NOW, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, LAURA INGRAHAM. THERE WAS NOTHING NEW HERE, LAURA. WE KNOW THAT. WE KNOW THAT THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, FBI DISAGREE AND ON TOP OF THAT WE KNOW THAT THE CIA HAS PLAYED POLITICS IN THE PAST. BENGHAZI, GREAT EXAMPLE.

I KNOW THE FOX NEWS POLL SHOWED IT'S 59% OF THE RESPONDERS DON'T THINK IT HAD ANY IMPACT. THE IDEA THAT THE VOTERS WERE OBSESSED WITH RUSSIA GETTING INTO DNC E-MAILS. THE QUESTION IS THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WAS IN HILLARY'S E-MAIL. WHY DID SHE DELETE E-MAILS, WHY DID HE SCRUB AND BLEACH HER E-MAILS.

IT'S SO TRANSPARENT. AND INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY FIXING THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE IN THEIR OWN PARTY THAT EVEN SOMETHING LIKE JOE MANCHIN ADMITTED TODAY. THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE MIDDLE CLASS WHITE VOTERS. INSTEAD OF THAT THEY 0 GO TO CONSPIRACY THEORIES. IT MAKES TRUMP LOOK STRONGER AND MAKES THEM LOOK SILLY.  >> IS THIS A PREVIEW OF COMING ATTRACTIO ATTRACTIONS.

DAVID BROCK HAS HIS ORGANIZATION THAT'S GOING TO BE DEVOTED TO GOING AFTER TRUMP MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT. BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY DO. THIS IS THEIR LIFE BLOOD. TRUMP IS THE BIG TROPHY.

ONE THING IS AN ATTEMPT TO SAY IF RUSSIA OR OTHER INTENENTITIE DIFFERENT SITES WHERE THEY SEND E-MAILS AND TRY TO FIND WAYS TO BREAK THROUGH DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS INTO DATA, THAT'S ONE THING. BUT THERE IS ZERO PROOF THEY HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE ELECTION IN TERMS OF THE OUTCOME AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS AN ATTEMPT BY FOLKS ON THE LEFT AND SOME FOLKS IN THE MEDIA FRANKLY TO DELEGITIMATIZE THE HUGE WIN DONALD TRUMP HAD AND I THINK IT'S SAD BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WERE 38 DAYS GOING PRIOR TO THE ELECTION IT WAS THE ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS IN THE MEDIA SAYING WE NEED TO HAVE INTEGRITY IN THE ELECTION AND ANYONE WHO QUESTIONS IT SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY VOTING SYSTEMS THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTION.  >> I FIND IT CURIOUS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA TODAY SAID WE KNEW THEY WERE HACKING YET HE CHOOSE NOW TO SAY IN HIS WORDS WE WILL TAKE ACTION.  >> I THINK THAT IF WE DO -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY GOTTEN LOST IN THIS -- I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO EVERYONE WATCHING, ANY FOREIGN ENTITY OR ANY ENTITY THAT SEEKS TO UNDERMINE OR INTERFERE IN A U.S. ELECTION SHOULD BE STOPPED, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED, IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON WHO HAD A SECRET SERVER THAT WASN'T IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. IT WAS THE DNC THAT CAME UP WITH THE TECHNOLOGY SECURITY MEASURES THAT'S BEEN REPORTED. IT WAS DAVID BROCK THAT WROTE THE THINGS THAT GOT OUT AND IT WAS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA THAT COVERED IT. THIS IS NOT DONALD TRUMP'S FAULT. THIS IS NOT THE REPUBLICAN'S FELT. THEY HAVE BROUGHT THIS SCANDAL TO THEIR DOORSTEP AND NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO DEFLECT FROM WHAT THEY BROUGHT TO THEMSELVES.  \n",

PRESIDENT OBAMA ADDRESSED THE ISSUE DURING AN INTERVIEW.  >> I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WHEN ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TRIES TO IMPACT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS, THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION AND WE WILL.  >> JOINING US NOW FROM WASHINGTON WITH REACTION, MICHAEL RUBEN, AUTHOR OF DANCING WITH THE DEVIL AND FROM HOUSTON NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. EARLIER TODAY PRESIDENT OBAMA IN HIS LONG PRESS CONFERENCE SAID OUR MESSAGE TO RUSSIA DON'T DO THIS TO US ANYMORE BECAUSE WE CAN DO STUFF TO YOU. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF TEETH IN THAT THREAT AGAINST RETALIATING AGAINST RUSSIAN HACKS.  >> PRESIDENT OBAMA APPARENTLY TOLD PRESIDENT PUTIN OF RUSSIA ABOUT A MONTH AGO THAT HE NEEDS TO CUT IT OUT, ACTUALLY ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION, TOLD THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT THAT YOU NEED TO CUT OUT THESE INTERFERENCES AND MEDDLING INTO OUR ELECTION. HERE'S WHAT HAPPEN  >> OR WHAT? HERE'S THE PROBLEM. CUT IT OUT TWO MONTHS AGO OR WE'LL DO STUFF TO YOU TODAY. I DON'T KNOW, IF I'M PUTIN, OKAY. I'LL STOP RIGHT NOW.  >> WELL, WE HAVE PLENTY OF TOOLS IN OUR ARSENAL THAT WE CAN HIT THE RUSSIANS BACK WITH. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. THERE ARE A FEW SACRED RIGHTS AS AN AMERICAN, RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY AND ONE OF THOSE SACRED RIGHTS IS THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND MAKE SURE THAT SYSTEM THAT'S THE SYSTEM IS PROTECTED AND SAFE. RUSSIAN GOVERNMENTS AND SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS IN THAT GOVERNMENT AND NOW WE KNOW PRESIDENT PUTIN HIMSELF, BECAUSE OF A PERSONAL --  >> I WANT TO GO TO MIKE --  >> THEY LEAKED IT AND THEY LEAKED IT AND THEY LEAKED IT --  >> BUT THERE'S NO RECOURSE. I HAVE A TEENAGER AND YOU KNOW WHAT TEENS RESPOND TO? PUNISHMENT. THEY DON'T RESPOND TO IDLE THREATS. STOP DOING THAT OR ELSE. THE OR ELSE IS WHAT REALLY COUNTS. YOUR THOUGHTS?  >> OBAMA HAS NO CREDIBILITY ON THE INTERNATIONAL FRONT. HE SHOULD START LEAKING THE DETAILS OF PUTIN'S BANK ACCOUNTS RIGHT AWAY. HE HAS NO ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE DOMESTIC FRONT BECAUSE WHEN THE CHINESE STOLE FILES FROM THE OFFICE OF OPM, OBAMA REFUSED TO NAME THE CHINESE BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID OF IT AND HE'S GOT NO CREDIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO SECURITY BECAUSE HE HASN'T PUNISHED ANYONE FOR LEAKS IN THIS SORT OF OPERATIONAL SECURITY.  >> WHAT ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA ADMITTING TODAY THAT, YEAH, HE WAS AWARE OF THE RUSSIAN HACKING, BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING AND NOW HE'S LEVELING A THREAT ON THIS DAY?  >> YOU KNOW WHAT CHILDREN DO RESPOND TO THREATS, BUT THEY RESPOND TO REWARDS AND THE BEST REWARD THE RUSSIAN CAN GET IS A RUSSIA FRIENDLY WHITE HOUSE AND DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO PROMISE THEM THAT. THAT WAS A MAIN THEME IN HIS CAMPAIGN. PEOPLE HE IS APPOINTING AND HAS APPOINTED ARE RUSSIA FRIENDLY. PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS WAGED A VERY STRONG CAMPAIGN OF SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIAN OCCUPATION OF UKRAINE AND ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA. THEY WERE CERTAIN THAT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD HAVE A TOUGHER POLICY AGAINST RUSSIA THAN DONALD TRUMP WOULD HAVE AND FOR THIS TIME THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS, 17 U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE CONFIRMING THAT SENIOR RUSSIAN OFFICIALS, INCLUDING VLADIMIR PUTIN, WERE TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE U.S. ELECTION TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.  >> WHY IS THAT? WHY IS THAT? SO YOU JUST TELL ME THAT THEY RESPOND TO REWARDS. WE'VE REWARDED RUSSIA BY NOT SANCTIONING THEM.  \n",

DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO LEFT THE SANCTIONS.  >> THESE SANCTIONS ARE NO TEETH. LET ME BRING MICHAEL IN.  >> ABSOLUTELY WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN HERE, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S ONE THING FOR OBAMA TO SAY THESE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE ON BOARD WITH THE ASSESSMENT, BUT IS HE REFUSING TO BRIEF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THAT'S BEEN ASKING FOR THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN IT. I'M SUSPICIOUS OF RUSSIA IS WE NEED FOR CONGRESS TO ASSERT ITS OVERSIGHT AND CALL OUT THE PRESIDENT NO MORE ANNOUNCEMENTS WITHOUT THE INTELLIGENCE TO BACK IT UP AND WHEN IT COMES TO REX TILLERSON IF CONGRESS WANTS THE SANCTIONS IN PLACE, THEY GOT TO PLAY HARDBALL WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND A GAME OF GOOD COP, BAD COP CAN GO A LONG WAY. WE HAD A STRATEGY.  >> WHAT ABOUT THAT? MICHAEL MAKES A GOOD POINT. I KNOW JAMES COMEY DECIDED HE'S SIGNING ON BOARD WITH THE CIA. I GET THAT, BUT WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE? CAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AT LEAST SEE THE EVIDENCE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IF THEY'RE ALL IN UNISON?  >> I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD DECLASSIFY AS MUCH OF THIS INTELLIGENCE AS POSSIBLE BEFORE DONALD TRUMP TAKES THE OFFICE AND I HOPE TO SEE A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION. THIS IS NOT A TRUMP VERSUS HILLARY ISSUE. THE RUSSIANS HAVE INFLUENCED AND MEDDLED IN ELECTIONS IN UKRAINE, IN MANY PLACES AROUND THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN EUROPE. WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT ON U.S. SOIL. LET'S HAVE A BIPARTISAN TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. I URGE THIS ADMINISTRATION TO DECLASSIFY AS MUCH AS HE CAN, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT, TO BE FRANK, I HAVE VERY LITTLE FAITH IN A REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED HOUSE AND SENATE THAT FOR SO LONG HAVE HESITATED TO ACTUALLY INVESTIGATE THESE ALLEGATIONS.  >> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID WE WILL TAKE ACTION. 35 DAYS LEFT UNTIL HE TOSSES THE KEYS TO DONALD TRUMP. SHOULD HE TAKE ACTION IN THOSE 35 DAYS AGAINST RUSSIA?  >> ABSOLUTELY. I PROMISE YOU THAT THERE WILL BE ACTION AND THERE WILL BE ACTION IN THOSE 35 DAYS. HOPEFULLY DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT REVERSE THOSE ACTIONS BECAUSE HE WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY SHOW A NICER FACE TO THE RUSSIANS. YES, PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD DECLASSIFY INTELLIGENCE AND SHOULD TAKE ACTION AND IF I WERE THE PRESIDENT AND HIS NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM I WOULD START DECLASSIFYING THOSE DOCUMENTS AND I WOULD START URGING CONGRESS TO APPOINT A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.  >> MICHAEL, SHOULD PRESIDENT OBAMA TAKE ACTION WITH 35 DAYS TO GO?  >> ABSOLUTELY IF HE HAS THE PROOF AND AMEN TO A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO THIS. WE HAVE TO PLAY HARDBALL FOR RUSSIA. FOR US DIPLOMACY IS HOW TO GET TO YES AND FOR RUSSIA IT'S A ZERO GAME AND WE CAN'T BLAME OUR PREDECESSORS.  >> GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE.  \n",

TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. WHAT A GROUP. AS YOU KNOW, FLORIDA IS MY SECOND HOME. IN MANY WAYS IT'S MY FIRST HOME. AND I LOVE THIS STATE, I LOVE THE PEOPLE, I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. YOU PROPELLED TO VICTORY A GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENT THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HERE? MAN. THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. THEY SAY WE BROKE THE RECORD TONIGHT BY THE WAY, FOLKS. WE BROKE THE RECORD. INCREDIBLE. INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THE PATRIOTS OF THIS AUDIENCE TONIGHT STOOD UP TO THE GLOBAL SPECIAL INTERESTS AND DELIVERED AN HISTORIC WIN FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER. WITH YOUR VOTES THE GREAT CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY DECLARED TO THE WORLD THAT FROM NOW ON IT'S GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST. AMERICA FIRST.  >> BREAKING, IT HAS NOW BEEN 38 DAYS SINCE MR. TRUMP DEFEATED HILLARY CLINTON AND EACH DAY HER DEFENDERS OFFER A DIFFERENT EXPLANATION ABOUT WHY SHE LOST. FROM THE RUSSIAN TO THE FBI DIRECTOR TO NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING AND WHITE RESENTMENT, WE'VE HEARD A STEADY LIST OF DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS. CLINTON SUPPORTERS HAVE NOT STOPPED TALKING ABOUT THIS, THE CANDIDATE AND HER TOP LIEUTENANTS HAVE MOSTLY BEEN QUIET UNTIL NOW. CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIR JOHN PODESTA FILED A PIECE FOR THE WASHINGTON POST SAYING THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT THE RUR SHAN PLOT AND THE FAILURE OF THE FBI TO ADEQUATELY RESPOND, THE MORE SHOCKING IT GETS. LAST NIGHT MRS. CLINTON DECIDED TO JOIN IN WITH HER OWN EXPLANATION OR EXCUSE, DEPENDING ON YOU VIEW.  >> IN CONVERSATIONS WITH HER SUPPORTERS IN THE DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, HILLARY CLINTON CERTAINLY MENTIONED FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY'S LETTER THAT RAISED NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT HIR PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER. BUT NOW IT APPEARS THAT HE'S MAKING A PUBLIC CASE THAT THE COMEY LETTER IS ONE OF TWO UNPRECEDENTED EVENTS THAT LED TO HER DEFEAT, SAYING IT COST HER CLOSE RACES IN BATTLEGROUND STATES QUOTING, SWING STATE VOTERS MADE THEIR DECISION IN THE FINAL DAYS BREAKING AGAINST ME BECAUSE OF THE FBI LETTER FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR COMEY. THE SECOND EVENT IS WHAT SHE CALLS RUSSIAN CYBERATTACKS ON DEMOCRATIC TARGETS. THESE ARE HER FIRST PUBLIC COMMENTS SINCE THE CIA SAYS IT BELIEVES THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WAS MEDDLING IN THE ELECTION. WATCH.  >> VLADIMIR PUTIN HIMSELF DIRECTED THE COVERT CYBERATTACKS AGAINST OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM, AGAINST OUR DEMOCRACY, APPARENTLY BECAUSE HE HAS A PERSONAL BEEF AGAINST ME. PUTIN PUBLICLY BLAMED ME FOR THE OUTPOURING OF OUTRAGE BY HIS OWN PEOPL PEOPLE. AND THAT IS THE DIRECT LINE BETWEEN WHAT HE SAID BACK THEN AND WHAT HE DID IN THIS ELECTION.  >> CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN JOHN PODESTA HIMSELF, A DIRECT TARGET OF HACKED E-MAILS RELEASED BY WIKILEAKS HAS WRITTEN AN OP-ED IN THE WASHINGTON POST HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE FBI. HE SITES AN ARTICLE SAYING WHEN THE FBI DISCOVERED THE RUSSIAN CYBERATTACK, IT FAILED TO SEND A SINGLE AGENT TO WARN DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE OFFICIALS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, TWO AGENTS WERE VISITING A TECH FIRM IN DENVER THAT HELPED MAINTAIN CLINTON'S E-MAIL SERVER. PODESTA WRITES, COMPARING THE FBI'S MASSIVE RESPONSE TO THE OVERBLOWN E-MAIL SCANDAL WITH THE SEEMINGLY LACKADAISICAL RESPONSE TO THE REAL RUSSIAN PLOT TO SUBVERT A NATIONAL ELECTION SHOWS THAT SOMETHING IS DEEPLY BROKEN AT THE FBI.

NOW INSTEAD OF JUST ACKNOWLEDGING A THAT HE WAS A TERRIBLY FLAWED CORRUPT CANDIDATE WITH A LONG TRACK RECORD OF FAILURE AND A LARGE MAJORITY OF AMERICAN VOTERS DIDN'T LIKE, THOUGHT WAS DISHONEST, HILLARY CLINTON IS BLAMING EVERYTHING BUT HERSELF FOR HER ELECTION LOSS. LAST NIGHT AT A SWANKY PARTY IN NEW YORK CITY, WELL HER AND HER LIBERAL ELITIST DONOR FRIENDS, THEY WENT OUT THERE.

IT'S THE FBI'S FAULT THAT YOU SET UP AN INSECURE SERVER IN A MOM AND POP SHOP CLOSET. IT'S THEIR FAULT. IT HAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON THAT COMPUTER SERVER THAT PUT AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY AT RISK. IT'S THEIR FAULT. HILLARY, THAT'S NOT THE FBI'S FAULT. THAT IS YOUR FAULT.

FOX NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT AN INTERNAL CIA MEMO CONFIRMS THAT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS NOW IN AGREEMENT THAT RUSSIA SOUGHT TO INTERFERE IN THE ELECTION BUT THE MEMO DOES NOT INCLUDE A REFERENCE THAT THERE WAS AN INTENTION TO AID DONALD TRUMP. THE CIA HAS BEEN TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS. THAT'S THE SAME AGENCY THAT LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING BY CHANGING THE BENGHAZI TALKING POINTS TO SAY TERRORISM WAS NOT TO BLAME. THEIR ARGUMENT SPONTANEOUS DEMONSTRATION RELATED TO YOUTUBE VIDEO AND THE DEMONSTRATORS JUST HAPPENED TORE MORTARS AND RP KBRGs IN THEIR BACK POCKET. PRESIDENT OBAMA REACTED TO CLINTON'S CLAIM EARLIER TODAY. LISTEN TO THIS.  >> WHEN I SAW PRESIDENT PUTIN IN CHINA, I FELT THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ENSURE THAT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WAS TO TALK TO HIM DIRECTLY. AND TELL HIM TO CUT IT OUT. THERE WERE GOING TO BE SOME SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES IF HE DIDN'T. 37% OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS APPROVE OF PUTIN.

      ">> OBAMA IS SO TOUGH, HE TOLD PUTIN AND CHINA TO CUT IT OUT. NOW IF THE PRESIDENT IS SO CONCERNED ABOUT INTERFERENCE IN ELECTIONS FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, THEN WHY DID A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION FIND THAT BACK IN 2014 AN ISRAELI POLITICAL GROUP USED 300,000 TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN THE OBAMA STATE DEPARTMENT IN A GRANT TO CREATE A POLITICAL APPARATUS TO TRY TO DEFEAT THE ISRAELI PRESIDENT, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. MR. PRESIDENT, WERE YOU TRYING TO INTERFERE IN ISRAEL'S ELECTIONS? THE FACTS FOR THEM, IT SAYS OTHERWISE. YESTERDAY I HAD THE FOUNDER OF WIKILEAKS, JULIAN ASAGE ON MY RADIO SHOW AND HE SAID RUSSIA DID NOT GIVE HIM THE PODESTA E-MAILS. DO THEY HAVE ANY PROOF? SO FOR THEY HAVEN'T PRESENTED IT. LISTEN TO AAGE.  >> OUR SOURCE IS NOT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.  >> LET ME BE CLEAR. RUSSIA DID NOT GIVE YOU THE PODESTA DOCUMENTS OR ANYTHING FROM THE DNC?  >> THAT'S CORRECT.  >> KU YOU CONFIRM IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION CONTAINING HACKED INFO FROM THE RNC?  >> WE RECEIVED -- PUBLIC SOMEWHERE ELSE.  >> WHETHER YOU LIKE JULIAN AAGE OR WIKILEAKS OR NOT, FOR TEN YEARS THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN PROVEN TO HAVE GOTTEN ANYTHING WRONG, NOT ONE TIME. THEN THERE'S PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE DAILY SHOW SAYING THERE WAS NO VOTE TAMPERING DONE BY T RUSSIANS IN THIS ELECTION. HE TOLD US HIMSELF. TAKE A LOOK.  >> WE WERE FRANKLY MORE CONCERNED IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF VOTE TAMPERING WHICH WE DID NOT SEE EVIDENCE OF AND WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE COULD GUARD AGAINST.  >> ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS THE SORE LOSER LEFT ACTING LIKE SPOILED LITTLE BRATS, THEY DIDN'T GET WHAT THEY WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS SO NOW THEY'RE GOING TO RUIN THE HOLIDAY FOR EVERYONE ELSE. HERE'S ONE THING THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT AND THAT IS WHAT WIKILEAKS ACTUALLY EXPOSED ABOUT THE CLINTONS AND THE DNC. IT'S ALL TRUE. IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING YOU HEARD WAS A LIE. NOW WIKILEAKS PROVED WHAT MANY OF US HAD SUSPECTED FOR A LONG TIME, THE CLINTONS ARE CORRUPT. THE MAINSTREAM ALT-LEFT MEDIA IS CORRUPT AS WELL AND THEY WERE COLLUDING WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. WE LEARNED THE DNC WORKED AGAINST BERNIE SANDERS IN A CORRUPT WAY AN WE LEARNED THAT SOME THE DNC E-MAILS CONTAINED RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC AND ANTI-SEMITIC LANGUAGE. IN MY OPINION THE COUNTRY WAS BETTER OFF BECAUSE THE TRUTH WAS TOLD TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOW ALL THE ADMINISTRATION CARES ABOUT IS HACKING. MY QUESTION TO PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN FOR EIGHT YEARS. LOOK AT THIS LIST. THESE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAVE BEEN HACKED DATING BACK TO 2012 AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T LIFT A FINGER TO TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES ON THIS PROGRAM, YES, JULIAN ASAGE IS CONTROVERSIAL BUT DID HE NOT DO US A FAVOR BY EXPOSING ONE OF OUR GLARING WEAKNESSES AND SHOULDN'T WE HAVE BEEN FIXING IT THE LAST EIGHT YEARS? IF THE LEFT IS SO UPSET ABOUT PUBLISHING STOLEN MATERIAL WERE IF YOU'RE REALLY CONSISTENT INTELLECTUALLY, WHERE WAS THE OUTRA OUTRAGE WHEN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTED DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURN. THEY REPORTED IT. IF WIKILEAKS HAD THE INFORMATION THAT WAS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, I THINK THE LEFT WOULD HAVE LOVED IT BEING EXPOSED. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WALL TO WALL COVERAGE EVERY DAY, EVERY MINUTE, EVERY NIGHT. WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO IS THIS. THE LEFT, THE MEDIA, THEY'RE MAD. THEY'RE ANGRY. THEY'RE IN DENIAL. THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT THAT THEY FAILED AND THAT THEY GOT EXPOSED AND IN THE END THEY LOST AND THEY CAN'T ADMIT THAT THEY FAILED. AND BY THE WAY, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEFT'S ATTITUDE BEFORE THE ELECTION, REMEMBER, WHEN THEY WERE TELLING DONALD TRUMP TO STOP RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE SYSTEM BEING RIGGED? REMEMBER WHEN OBAMA JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION SAID THIS?  \n",

THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST OR THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES IN WHICH THAT WILL HAPPEN THIS TIME. AND SO I'D ADVISE MR. TRUMP TO STOP WHINING AND TRY TO MAKE HIS CASE TO GET VOTE.  >> PRESIDENT OBAMAS AND HILLARY CLINTON NEED TO STOP WHINING. HILLARY CLINTON DID THE SAME THING. REMEMBER THIS BEFORE THE ELECTION.  >> THAT'S HORRIFYING. YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME DONALD THINKS THINGS ARE NOT GOING IN HIS DIRECTION, HE CLAIMS WHATEVER IT IS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. NOW, MAKE NO MISTAKE, BY DOING THAT HE IS THREATENING OUR DEMOCRACY.  >> HILLARY, STOP WHINING AND COMPLAINING. LISTEN TO YOUR OWN WORDS, YOUR OWN CRITICISM. BECAUSE WHAT YOU SAID AND WHAT THE LEFT IS DOING IS YOU'RE ADVANCING A FALSE CONSPIRACY THEORY AS TO WHY YOU LOST. YOU CAN'T ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S ALSO TIME FOR HILLARY TO STOP MAKING IT ALL ABOUT HER. FOR DECADES SHE'S BEEN PLAYING THAT SAME VICTIM CARD, THE SAMER TROUBLES AND SCANNEDMENTS ON SOMEONE ELSE.

HOW DO YOU SBEINTERPRET THIS?  >> WHEN IT SUITS THEM THEY CALL ON DONALD TRUMP TO STOPCYING THINGS THAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE UNTRUTHFUL. BUT WHEN DONALD TRUMP WINS THE ELECTION, NOW THEY'RE SAYING NO, IT'S THE RUSSIAN'S FAULT, THAT THE RUSSIANS DID SOMETHING THAT JULIAN ASAGE WAS ALIGNED TO HELP DONALD TRUMP. EVERY SINGLE E-MAIL THAT WAS PUBLISHED FROM THE PODESTA E-MAIL CHAIN HAS PROVEN TO BE AUTHENTIC AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DID NOT WANT TO AUTHENTICATE THOSE. BUT THEY HAVE NEVER EVER SAID THAT THOSE E-MAILS WERE WRONG OR THAT THEY WEREN'T AUTHENTIC BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEM TO BE TRUE. THIS IS SOUR GRAPES IS WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO.  >> TELL ME WHERE THE EVIDENCE IS THAT RUSSIA IS INVOLVED. NOW THE DAILY MAIL HAD A REPORT YESTERDAY ABOUT THIS GUY CRAIG, I BELIEVE HIS LAST NAME IS MURRAY. AND CRAIG MURRAY SAYS HE GOT THEM DIRECTLY FROM A DEMOCRAT WHO WAS DISGRUNTLED BECAUSE BERNIE SANDERS HAD BEEN CHEATED AND THE CORRUPTION AT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND THE ACTUAL E-MAILS WERE HANDED OFF PERSONALLY IN A WOODED AREA. WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO BE TRUE?  >> LOOK. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO HARD FAST EVIDENCE. WE HEARD PRESIDENT OBAMA SAY DIRECTLY THAT THE RUSSIANS WEREN'T INVOLVED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. AND THE SYSTEM IS SO DECENTRALIZED THAT THERE'S NO INDIVIDUAL WAY TO STEAL THE ELECTION. THIS ELECTION WAS NOT STOLEN. DONALD TRUMP WENT OUT, HE CONNECTED WITH THE VOTERS AND LOOK AT WHAT THE STOCK MARKET HAS DONE SINCE DONALD TRUMP HAS TAKEN OVER AS PRESIDENT-ELECT. IT IS THROUGH THE ROOF. MORE PEOPLE ARE MORE MONEY TO SPEND AT CHRISTMAS.  >> LITET'S LOOK AT THIS OBJECTIVELY. WE'RE TO BELIEVE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC BLUE WALL THAT BROKE DOWN IN IOWA, OHIO, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN AND PENNSYLVANIA, STATES THAT HAVE A LOT IN COMMON ECONOMICALLY, THAT THOSE ARE THE ONLY STATES THAT WERE THE ONES THAT WERE INFLUENCED BY QUOTE VLADIMIR PUTIN AND RUSSIAN HACKING. WOULDN'T IT BE MORE LIKELY THAT IT WAS THE MESSAGE THAT WE CAN GET AMERICA BACK TO WORK, PUTTING AMERICA FIRST, BRINGING IN MANUFACTURING? ISN'T IT MORE LIKELY THAT THOSE STATES WHO HAVE SUFFERED DISPROPORTIONATELY TO OTHERS THAT THE MESSAGE IS WHAT MADE THOSE STATES CHANGE, OTHERWISE THE WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BOUGHT INTO RUSSIAN HACKING, RIGHT?  \n",

FIRST, HE MUST SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE EVIDENCE AND SECOND HE MUST APPLY SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PUTIN GOVERNMENT. THESE CYBER ATTACKS ARE JUST THAT ATTACKS.

YOU'VE BEEN BRIEFED ON THE PARTY'S COMPUTER SYSTEM. IS THAT RIGHT? THEY STOPPED?  >> NO. THEY DID NOT STOP. THEY CAME AFTER US EVERY DAY UNTIL THE END OF THE ELECTION.

SO, NO PRESSURE WAS PUT ON PRESIDENT OBAMA TO STOP THE MADNESS WHEN IT WAS UNCOVERED. BUT NOW IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.  \n",

      "WELCOME TO \"HANNITY.\" MEMBERS OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE FORMALLY CAST THEIR VOTES TO MAKE DONALD TRUMP THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. EARLIER TODAY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE PUT DONALD TRUMP OVER THE 270 THRESHOLD NEEDED TO BECOME THE NEXT COMMANDER IN CHIEF, DESPITE ALL OF THIS, DEMOCRATS ARE CONTINUING TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AND ARE STILL REFUSING TO ACCEPT THE ELECTION RESULTS. ACCORDING TO POLITICO, IN AN INTERVIEW WITH HIS HOMETOWN NEWSPAPER, FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON TOOK SEVERAL SHOTS AT PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP SAYING, QUOTE ONE ONE THING HE DOES KNOW IS HOW TO GET ANGRY WHITE MEN TO VOTE FOR HIM. CLINTON BLAMED THE FBI FOR HIS WIFE'S LIFE SAYING QUOTE JAMES COMEY COST HER THE ELECTION. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. JOHN PODESTA IS MAKING HEADLINES FOR REFUSING TO SAY THAT THE ELECTION WAS FREE AND FAIR. WATCH THIS.  >> DO YOU BELIEVE THEIS WAS A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION?  >> I BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS CLEARLY INTERVENED IN THE ELECTION AND I THINK NOW WE KNOW THAT MOST OF CIA, THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, THE FBI ALL AGREE THAT THE RUSSIANS INTERVENED TO HELP TRUMP.  >> YOU DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS WAS A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION?  >> WELL I THINK IT WAS DISTORTED BY THE RUSSIAN INTERVENTION. LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY.  >> CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THE TABLES WERE TURNED AND DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN SAID THE SAME THING? WHEN YOU HAVE DONNA BRAZILE WHO WIKILEAKS EXPOSED AS HAVING GIVEN DEBATE AND TOWN HALL QUESTIONS TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. SHE'S TALKING TO DEMOCRAT RUSHING HACKING TALKING POINTS TO A NEW LOW LEVEL. WATCH THIS.  >> THIS WAS A VERY INTRUSIVE PROCESS. THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY WAS HACKED. NOT THE DEMOCRATS. HIS PARTY WAS HACKED. THE E-MAILS WERE WEAPONIZED. THE RELEASE OF STOLEN HACKED E-MAILS CAUSED A LOT OF CONFUSION AND OF COURSE IT DISRUPTED OUR DAILY CAMPAIGN LIVES. DONALD TRUMP USED THIS INFORMATION IN WAYS TO ALSO SEW DIVISION. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HIS REPEATED USAGE OF SOME OF THE STOLEN INFORMATION. HE USED IT AS IF HE RECEIVED DAILY TALKING POINTS.  >> AS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE'S STILL MAKING EXCUSES BUT APPEARS TO BE FINALLY ADMITTING THAT THE MAIN REASON PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP WON IS BECAUSE HE OUTWORKED HILLARY CLINTON ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. WATCH THIS.  >> OFTENTIMES YOUNGER VOTERS, MINORITY VOTERS, DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE CLUSTERED IN URBAN AREAS.  >> AND ON THE COASTS.  >> AND ON THE COASTS. SO AS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE NOT ONLY ENTIRE STATES BUT ALSO BIG CHUNKS OF STATES WHERE IF WE'RE NOT SHOWING UP, IF WE'RE NOT IN THERE MAKING AN ARGUMENT, THEN WE'RE GOING TO LOSE. AND WE CAN LOSE BADLY AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS ELECTION.  >> JOINING US NOW WITH REACTION IS THE AUTHOR OF THE BEST SELLING BOOK \"TREASON\" FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NEWT GINGRICH. WANT TO GET TO THE ELECTION RESULTS AND THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE IN A SECOND. BUT FIRST, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN EUROPE. FIRST WE SAW EARLIER TODAY WE SAW THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IN TURKEY BEING ASSASSINATED ON TELEVISION, ACTUALLY VIDEOTAPED AND THEN LATER ON WE THAER THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS CALLING THE BERLIN GERMANY TRUCK THAT PLOWED INTO THE CHRISTMAS MARKET A QUOTE TERROR ATTACK. YOUR THOUGHTS. TELL US WHAT YOU SEE GOING ON.  >> WELL, CLEARLY THE MAN, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE MAN WHO KILLED THE RUSSIAN AM BES DOOR WAS AN ISLAMIC SUPREMACIST. THAT HAS TOOK AN ACT OF TERRORI TERRORISM. ALMOST CERTAINLY THE TRUCK IN GERMANY WAS AN ACT OF TERRORISM. IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE IF IT WAS A PERSON WHO IS A REFUGEE. IT WILL PUT ANGELA MERKEL'S GOVERNMENT IN DEEPER TROUBLE. SO THIS IS JUST PART OF THE DANGERS OF THE WORLD WE NOW LIVE IN. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT TOURISTS WERE ATTACKED IN JORDAN, SOMETHING THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL. BUT YESTERDAY A GROUP OF TOURISTS WERE AT A CASTLE IN JORDAN AND 12 OF THEM WERE KILLED. VERY UNUSUAL HAPPENING. WE'RE UP AGAINST A WORLDWIDE EFFORT AND WE HAVE NO CURRENT STRATEGY CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH THAT PROBLEM.  \n",

A FEDERAL JUDGE YESTERDAY UNSEALED THE SEARCH WARRANT THAT SHOWED AGENTS WERE CONCERNED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER MADE IT TO ANTHONY WEINER'S COMPUTER. WEINER IS THE ESTRANGED HUSBAND OF CLINTON AID HUMA ABEDIN. CURRENTLY UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION FOR SEXTING WITH AN UNDERAGED GIRL. PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP RAISED THE ALARM ABOUT THE SITUATION DURING THE CAMPAIGN.  >> UMA IS GETTING CLASSIFIED SECRETS. SHE IS MARRIED TO ANTHONY WEINER WHO IS A PERV. NO, HE IS. HE IS. DO YOU THINK THERE IS EVEN A 5% CHANCE THAT SHE IS NOT TELLING ANTHONY WEINER NOW OF A PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM WHAT THE HELL IS COMING ACROSS? DO YOU THINK THERE IS EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANCE? I DON'T THINK SO.  >> JOINING US NOW FROM WASHINGTON, JOHN FLANNERY A FORM ARE FEDERAL PROSECUTOR AND FROM PALM BEACH GARDENS FLORIDA DAN BONGINO A FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT AND RADIO TALK SHOW HOST. SO FLANNERY, YOU JUST HAVE TO ADMIT THAT PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP WAS CORRECT IN HIS ASSESSMENT ABOUT ANTHONY WEINER. DOES IT PAIN YOU TO ADMIT THAT TRUMP IS CORRECT?  >> YES. THAT HER HUSBAND WAS A PERV? I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS THE QUESTION.  >> NO, THAT THERE WAS INFORMATION ON WEINER'S LAPTOP.  >> WELL, THERE WAS NO PROBABLE CAUSE TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT.

AND WITHIN DAYS OF GETTING A COURT ORDER, SAYING THEY WEREN'T GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT, IS HE TALKING ABOUT IT EVERYWHERE WITHIN DAYS OF THE ELECTION. AND THEN FINALLY THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.  >> LET ME JUST STOP YOU THERE.  >> OKAY.  >> SO THE FBI GUYS ARE LOOKING INTO WEINER'S LAPTOP BECAUSE IS HE SECTING SOME TEENAGE CHICK AND THEY FIND OUT PROBABLE CAUSE THAT THERE ARE COMMUNICATIONS, PROBABLE CAUSE TO LOOK.  >> NO, NO, NO, NO.  >> COMMUNICATIONS POTENTIALLY BETWEEN HUMA ABEDIN AND HILLARY CLINTON.

HERE IS MY POINT. BOTH HILLARY AND ABEDIN BOTH HAD SECURITY CLEARANCES. THEY ARE ALLOWED TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT THESE THINGS. NUMBER TWO, THEY HAD THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE 2000 OR WHATEVER LESS NUMBER OF EMAILS THAT WERE IN QUESTION AND ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS THEY CAN IT WITH THE ONES THEY INVESTIGATED DURING THE SUMMER. A SHORT TIME LATER AFTER THE ELECTION -- JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION THEY SAID YES, THEY ARE DUPLICATES.  >> I KNOW.  >> THERE WAS NO PROBABLE CAUSE TO COMMITTED SEARCH.  >> FLANNERY OKAY WITH MILLER'S CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON WEINER'S LAPTOP WHAT DO YOU SAY?  >> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO JOHN HE IS COMPLETELY EMBARRASSING HIMSELF ON ONE OF THE LARGEST CABLE TV SHOWS OUT THERE.

DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GIVING IS BEING GIVEN THE ABILITY TO START HIS PRESIDENCY WITHOUT HAVING TO UNDO MORE OF OBAMA'S FECKLESS POLICY AND ALSO WE HAVE TO REMIND THIS. OBAMA'S FIRST TRANSITION PERIOD IS A SMOOTH TRANSITION OF GOVERNMENT THAT SHOULD BE TAKING UP ALL HIS TIME BUT IT'S NOT. AND HE IS SENDING ALSO A MESSAGE TO OTHERS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING ON A SMOOTH TRANSITION THAT LET'S NOT DO WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING FOR DONALD TRUMP. LET HIM FEND FOR HIMSELF WHEN HE TAKES OFFICE. BECAUSE IF YOU BELIEVE WHAT MATT SAYS THAT A SMOOTH TRANSITION ISN'T NECESSARY BECAUSE OBAMA'S POLICIES TRUMP THAT.  >> IT IS. IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT SEPARATES US FROM LESSER DEMOCRACIES AS I SAID EARLIER.  >> LET ME ASK YOU. THIS I'M GOING TO POSIT THIS. I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS DIVERTING FROM WHAT HIS LEGACY WILL BE RIGHT NOW AS IT IS RIGHT NOW HE WILL OVERSEE THE MORALITY DESTRUCTION OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. SO IF HE PUTS UP ALL THESE INITIATIVES, THE U.N. RESOLUTION, THE SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA, MAYBE WE WILL FORGET THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE BASICALLY FALLING APART OVER THE LAST 8 YEARS.  >> I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT HE IS OVERSEEING. OBVIOUSLY WE LOST THIS ELECTION. IT HAPPENS. WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND WORK AND TRY TO LEARN SOME LESSONS AND COME BACK STRONGER. I DID WANT TO ADDRESS WHAT BRAD SAID ABOUT THE TRANSITION. EVEN THE TRUMP TRANSITION HAD SAID THAT AT AN OPERATIONAL LEVEL THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS WORKED VERY HARD TO BRIEF THEIR SUCCESSORS ON POLICY, TO HAND OVER THINGS SMOOTHLY. THAT'S HAPPENING. THERE IS ONE SIDE THAT CONTINUES TO CROSS THE LINE. IT, IN FACT, IS THE TRUMP -- THE TRUMP TRANSITION WHICH IS DELVING INTO FOREIGN POLICY WHICH IS HE ACTUALLY NOT THE PRESIDENT. THAT RESPONSIBILITY STILL LIES WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA.  >> ALL RIGHT. BRAD, I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT HIS CLOCK CLEANED. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS DID. BUT SO DOES LINDSEY GRAHAM. LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ON PUTIN, RUSSIA AND OWE BOMBMA. LISTEN.  >> WHEN IT COMES TO OBAMA PUTIN, PUTIN HAS CLEANED HIS CLOCK. AND IN TERMS OF OBAMA TAKING ACTION, I DON'T THINK IT WILL DO ANY GOOD. THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU NEED TO HIT RUSSIA IN A SUSTAINED FASHION. SO IF OBAMA TRIES TO DO SOMETHING GOING OUT THE DOOR THAT'S NOT SUSTAINED, THEN YOU SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL. IF I WERE PRESIDENT TRUMP, I WOULD CALL PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SAY DON'T START SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T FINISH. LET TRUMP AND THE NEW CONGRESS DO THIS.  >> OKAY NOW, BRAD, WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS PRESIDENT OBAMA THIS MORNING PROMISED TO ADMINISTER SANCTIONS. WELL, ACTUALLY THIS MORNING HE SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE PUNISHMENT TO RUSSIA. WE WAITED ALL DAY AND THIS AFTERNOON WE HEAR THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF STEPPED UP SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA. AGAIN, 23 DAYS LEFT BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE. SANCTIONING RUSSIA, YOUR THOUGHTS?  >> THIS IS CRAZY. IT'S ANOTHER BOGUS LINE IN THE SAND AND BY THE WAY PUTIN IS LAUGHING SLEEVE. YOU HAVE THE LAMEST OF DUCK PRESIDENTS WHO HE HAS HAD NO RELATIONSHIP WITH AND AS LINDSEY GRAHAM PROPERLY POINTED OUT CLEANED HIS CLOCK THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. YOU THINK ANYTHING THAT THIS GUY DOES IS GOING TO HAVE ANY EFFECT ON RUSSIA? BY THE WAY IT'S UP TO THE NEW CONGRESS AND THE NEW PRESIDENT TO DEAL WITH RUSSIA EFFECTIVELY. STARTING A NEW RELATIONSHIP FROM STRENGTH NOT WEAKNESS. THAT'S EXACTLY THE WEAK POINT THAT OBAMA IS PUTTING IN TRUMP'S LAP.  >> DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT PUTIN IS, I DON'T KNOW, DO YOU THINK IS HE NERVOUS PUT HIS SHIRT ON AND GOT OFF THE SHORES. I'M GOING TO GET SANCTIONS SLAPPED ON ME BY PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO HAS 23 DAYS LEFT IN OFFICE?  >> LET'S SEE WHAT THE SANCTIONS LOOK LIKE. HERE IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW.  >> SO, WHAT CAN THEY DO? IF THE SANCTIONS IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.  >> WE DON'T KNOW YET WHETHER THEY ARE TOOTHLESS OR NOT. THEY MIGHT SANCTION PUTIN HIMSELF. IN ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE OF RUSSIA.  >> DO YOU THINK, HERE IS THE -- STANDING HERE ON THE FACTOR TONIGHT, AT 8:07 OR SO. AND SAY THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GOING TO SANCTION VLADIMIR PUTIN DIRECTLY?  >> I DON'T THINK WE KNOW. I THINK WE WILL FIND OUT TOMORROW. IT MIGHT BE HIM. IT MIGHT BE PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM. WE DO KNOW THAT SANCTIONS IN THE PAST PUTIN HAS REACTED VERY STRONGLY TO THEM. HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

THREE WEEKS AGO WE HAD ALL THREE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES COME OUT AND SAY IT WAS CLEARLY THE RUSSIANS THAT WAS TRYING TO IMPACT THE OUTCOME OF OUR ELECTION, THIS WAS CLEARLY AN APPROPRIATE ACTION FOR OUR PRESIDENT TO TAKE.

BUT TO SAY THIS INVOLVEMENT FROM RUSSIA S WHETHER IT WAS WITH THE DNC OR PODESTA'S E-MAILS HAD ANY IMAGINE PACT ON THE ELECTION OF AMERICAN PEOPLE. FOREIGN POLICY, THAT'S WHAT DROVE THEM TO THE BALLOT BOX TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THIS WAS NOT ANYTHING THAT CAME OUT FROM THE SILLY AND FOOLISH E-MAILS FROM THE DNC, WE DIDN'T REALLY CARE THAT THE DNC WAS SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON OVER BERNIE SANDERS.

TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED A SLEW OF SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS AND ENTITIES FOR CYBER HACKING AIMED AT INTERFERING WITH THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS KICKING OUT 35 RUSSIAN OFFICIALS CURRENTLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS SHUTTING DOWN TWO RUSSIAN COMPOUNDS IN MARYLAND AND NEW YORK THAT WERE APPARENTLY USED FOR SPYING. PRESIDENT OBAMA ADDED IN HIS STATEMENT THAT AMERICAN DIPLOMATS IN THE PAST YEAR HAVE EXPERIENCED, QUOTE: UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF HARASSMENT IN MOSCOW. UNQUOTE. AND NOW A SPOKESMAN FOR RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN SAYS MOSCOW IS CONSIDERING RETALIATION. SO WHAT DOES THE INCOMING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ALL OF THIS? JOINING US NOW FROM PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF REINCE PRIEBUS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BIG IMPORTANT DAY, REINCE. MR. CHAIRMAN, LET ME PUT THAT CORRECTLY. MR. CHAIRMAN, BIG IMPORTANT DAY. GLAD TO HAVE YOU. SO, THE PRESIDENT-ELECT'S REACTION TO PRESIDENT OBAMA, THE LAME DUCK PRESIDENT WITH JUST 21 DAYS LEFT TO GO. SLAPPING SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?  >> WELL, I MEAN, THE PRESIDENT-ELECT PUT OUT A STATEMENT AND HE SAID, LOOK, IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS. BUT, ALSO, NEVERTHELESS, WE'RE GOING TO BE MEETING AND HE IS GOING TO BE MEETING WITH INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS NEXT WEEK. TO TALK ABOUT THIS REPORT. AND FIND OUT THE DETAILS OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, HOW THE INVESTIGATION TOOK PLACE. AND MAYBE AT THAT TIME OR MAYBE LATER HE'LL HAVE A RESPONSE. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST NOT IN A POSITION TO SIT HERE AND RESPOND TO ALL OF THESE DETAILS BEFORE WE HAVE A FULL BLOWN INTELLIGENCE REPORT ON THIS PARTICULAR MATTER.  >> SO HE IS GOING TO SIT AND LOOK FOR THE EVIDENCE. A LOT OF US ON THE RIGHT HAVE BEEN SAYING WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE? WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE ACCUSATIONS SAYING THAT THE RUSSIANS ACTUALLY AFFECTED THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION, BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT. DO YOU THINK THIS -- HE IS GOING TO ASK FOR SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AND EVIDENCE FROM OUR INTEL DEPARTMENTS.  >> WELL, YEAH. I MEAN I THINK WE ALL DESERVE IT HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS, ERIC, YOU KNOW THIS AS WELL AS ANYBODY. I HAVE BEEN AND WE HAVE BEEN RESPONDING TO ARTICLES FROM THIRD PARTIES, UNNAMED SOURCES IN THE \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" AND THE \"NEW YORK TIMES.\" AND IN THOSE SAME ARTICLES IT WOULD SAY THAT THE 17 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES DIDN'T AGREE WITH EACH OTHER ON THE CONCLUSION THAT WAS ACTUALLY BEING REPORTED BY THE THIRD PARTY WHICH WAS THE ANONYMOUS SOURCE IN THE NEWSPAPER. SO, WE JUST NEED TO GET TO A POINT OURSELVES WHERE WE CAN TALK TO ALL OF THESE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND FIND OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE, HOW BAD IS IT? AND, LOOK, I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS AND THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AGREES WITH. THIS WE AGREE THAT FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS SHOULDN'T BE HACKING AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS, PERIOD. SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE CONDONE THE HACKING OF INSTITUTIONS AND ENTITIES AND BUSINESSES IN AMERICA. OF COURSE NOT. IT'S WRONG AND SOMETHING WE DON'T AGREE WITH. HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD GET TO A PLACE WHERE THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, AS IN UNISON CAN TELL US WHAT IT IS THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON AND WHAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS AND WHAT IT'S LED TO. SO THAT WE CAN RESPOND AND WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THAT. SO, WE'RE NOT FRUSTRATED. WE'RE JUST GETTING TO THE PLACE WHERE THOSE FACTS WILL COME TO LIFE.  >> SO WE HAVE A LAME DUCK PRESIDENT WHO SLAPPED SOME SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA WITH 22 DAYS LEFT IN HIS PRESIDENCY. AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TWO REPUBLICANS, SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN AND LINDSEY GRAHAM TODAY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN THE NEW CONGRESS IS IN SESSION WE'RE GOING TO LEAD THE CHARGE UP THE SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA. ARE THEY PREMATURE?  \n",

AMONG OTHER THINGS THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS SHUTTING DOWN TWO RUSSIAN COMPOUNDS AND DECLARING 35 RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES PERSONA NON-GRATA. HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN CALLED THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS QUOTE LONG OVERDUE. MEANWHILE CALLED THE DEATH THROWS OF POLITICAL CORPORATION CORPSES. JOINING US IS NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST AND FROM WASHINGTON CLIFF MAY FOUNDER OF THE FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES. ARESH, START WITH YOU. SO BIG STUFF GOING ON.

AND THAT'S WHAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD LIKE TO SAY. THEY TWEETED THIS LAME DUCK SORT OF TAKING A PAGE NOW FROM DONALD TRUMP'S TWITTER MANUAL TO MOCK EVERYTHING AND MAKE FUN OF EVERYTHING. BUT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. THEY MEDDLED IN OUR ELECTION. OUR PRESIDENT HAS EVERY RIGHT TO TARGET THEM AND HIT THEM BACK. HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT SOONER. I'M GLAD HE IS DOING IT I HOPE HE DECLASSIFIED MORE INFO. WHAT DONALD TRUMP ALL HIS PRO-RUSSIA FRIENDLY LOVE FROM RUSSIA RHETORIC IS GOING TO REVERSE WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE CORRECTLY, RIGHTLY AND JUSTIFIABLY. I WANT TO SEE MUCH TOUGHER ACTION AGAINST RUSSIA. YOU KNOW WHAT? FRANKLY, THE RUSSIANS ARE NOT JUST A RIVAL. THEY ARE A FIERCE ADVERSARY AND THEY HAVE EXACTLY OPPOSITE INTERESTS IN THE REGION IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN EUROPE AND HERE NOW ON THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.  >> OKAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE SANCTIONS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASED TODAY? DO YOU THINK THEY WILL HAVE THE TEETH THAT A ARASH THINKS THEY WILL HAVE OR MORE A PLAY TO KIND OF BOX PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP BECOMING PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP IN A CORNER? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO GO AGAINST THESE SANCTIONS?  >> YEAH, LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, THESE SANCTIONS ARE A DAY LATE AND A RYU BELL SHORT. AND SECONDLY THEY ARE MOSTLY SYMBOLIC. THEY TARGET INDIVIDUALS, COMPANIES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT DON'T HAVE ACHE SETS IN THE U.S. THAT AREN'T COME TO THE U.S. SO THIS IS LARGELY FOR SHOW. WHAT I HOPE IT DOES FOCUS ON IS SOMETHING THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID NOT FOCUS ON IN A COMPREHENSIVE MANNER DURING THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. AND THAT IS THE THREAT OF BOTH CYBER ESPIONAGE AND CYBER WARFARE, KINETIC WARFARE, DOING DESTRUCTIVE ACTIVITY. ESPIONAGE WE ALL DO. WE ARE USING CYBER ESPIONAGE AS WELL. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE RUSSIANS INTREERD -- WELL THEY INTREERD WITH OUR ELECTION WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAD ANY IMPACT ON OUR ELECTION. OF COURSE PRESIDENT OBAMA INTERFERED IN ISRAEL'S ELECTION A COUPLE YEARS AGO SPENT TAXPAYER MONEY TO DEFEAT NETANYAHU. WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FOCUS ON CYBER ESPIONAGE AND DECIDE WHERE OUR RED LINES ARE AND AS FAR AS CYBER WARFARE GOES WE NEED TO WIN CYBER ARMS RACE.  >> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DECIDED THEY ARE GOING TO EXPEL SOME 35 RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS THAT -- I GUESS THAT WOULD BE CALLED SPIES. OTHERWISE HE WOULD LET THEM STAY SO THEY WOULD GET RID OF THEM AND SHUTTING DOWN TWO COMPOUNDS CALL THEM SPY OR HUBS THEMSELVES. WHY NOW? IF THEY KNEW ABOUT THESE THINGS, GET RID OF THESE MONTHS OR YEARS AGO?  >> WE HAVE CONFIRMATION NOW FROM 17 DIFFERENT INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT NOT ONLY THE RUSSIANS WERE INVOLVED.  >> DO WE?  >> DO WE?  >> OH, WE DO.  >> ARASH, DO WE HAVE EVIDENCE.  >> WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE.  >> WHERE IS IT.  >> ABSOLUTELY. IT WILL BE DECLASSIFIED.  >> WHERE IS IT.  >> DO YOU TRUST THE RUSSIANS OR THE 17 AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.  >> DECIDED TO GO WITH THE SANCTIONS WITHOUT SHOWING JUST ONE FORM OF EVIDENCE. JUST PROVE IT I'M NOT SAYING HE DOESN'T HAVE IT BUT BEFORE DO YOU SOMETHING, SHOW IT.  >> THIS IS RICH. THIS IS REALLY RICH.

      "BREAKING TONIGHT, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES ITS RETALIATION AGAINST RUSSIA FOR THEIR CYBERATTACKS MEANT TO INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS. AS TENSIONS BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW HEAT UP. JUST 22 DAYS AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP ASSUMING THE PRESIDENCY. WELCOME TO \"THE KELLY FILE.\" I'M SANDRA SMITH IN FOR MEGYN KELLY. THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY ANNOUNCING THEIR PUNITIVE ACTIONS INCLUDING THE SANCTIONING OF NINE INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES, THE REMOVAL OF 35 RUSSIA INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES FROM THE UNITED STATES AND THE CLOSURE OF TWO RUSSIAN OWNED COMPOUNDS IN NEW YORK AND MARYLAND. WHEN ASKED WHY THE ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T LEAVE THIS DECISION TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION, ERIC SCHULTZ RESPONDED WITH THIS.  >> THE PRESIDENT IS LEAVING OFFICE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS BUT HE'S THE PRESIDENT FROM NOW UNTIL THEN. AND THE PRESIDENT-ELECT ONCE HE ASSUMES OFFICE ON JANUARY 20TH WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS.  >> SCHULTZ WAS ASKED ABOUT CONCERNS THAT THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE IS TRUMP INTO A DIPLOMATIC CORNER.  >> IF THE NEXT PRESIDENT WANTS TO DECIDE TO REALLOW IN SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS FROM RUSSIA, THEY CAN DO THAT. IF THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO LIFT SANCTIONS AGAINST SENIOR RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE, THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND DO THAT.  >> AS FOR HIS PART, MR. TRUMP SAID QUOTE, IT'S TOO MANY FOR OUR COUNTRY TO MOVE ON TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS. NEVERTHELESS IN THE SPRES OF OUR COUNTRY AND ITS GREAT PEOPLE I WILL MEET WITH LEADERS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY NEXT WEEK IN ORDER TO BE UPDATED ON THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION. WE'LL HAVE REACTION FROM PETE HOEKSTRA AND CHARITY HURT. BUT WE BEGIN WITH WHITE HOUSE KEVIN CORK WHO IS IN HONOLULU WITH THE PRESIDENT.  >> Reporter: GOOD EVENING FROM HAWAII. 72 HOURS, THAT'S HOW LONG THREE DOZEN RUSSIAN OPERATIVES HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE U.S. THEY HAVE BEEN EXPELLED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AT LEAST IN PART IN RETALIATION FOR ALLEGED RUSSIAN CYBER HACKING ACTIVITY. PRESIDENT OBAMA MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT HIS DECISION TODAY AND IT READS IN PART, THESE ACTIONS FOLLOW REPEATED PRIVATE AND PUBLIC WARNINGS THAT WE HAVE ISSUED TO THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND ARE A NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO HARM U.S. INTEREST IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL NORMS OF BEHAVIOR. HE WENT ON TO ADD THIS, THESE ACTIONS ARE NOT THE SUM TOTAL OF OUR RESPONSE TO RUSSIA'S AGGRESSIVE ACTIVITIES. WE'LL CONTINUE TO TAKE A VARIETY OF ACTIONS AT A TIME AND PLACE OF OUR CHOOSING, SOME OF WHICH WILL NOT BE PUBLICIZED.  >> OUR BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHAT RUSSIA AS BEEN ENGAGED IN IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THE PRESIDENT IS SENDING A MESSAGE TO TELL THEM TO CUT IT OUT. THAT'S WHY HE ORDERED AEXPRESSIVE ACTION.  >> Reporter: AS YOU KNOW, THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT SHY OF ACCUSING VLADIMIR PUTIN OF ORCHESTRATING THE ATTACKS. OF COURSE IT ALL EXPOSED ALLEGATIONS OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY INFIGHTING AND A CONCERTED EFFORT BY SENIOR PARTY OFFICIALS TO BOOST THE CAN DEN SOIF EVENTUAL PARTY NOMINEE, HILLARY CLINTON. THE RUSSIANS SNAPPED BACK RIDICULING PRESIDENT OBAMA WITH A TWEET, WRITING, I'M QUOTING, PRESIDENT OBAMA EXPELLED 31 DIPLOMATS IN COLD WAR DEJA VU AS EVERYBODY WILL BE GLAD TO SEE THIS LAST OF THIS HAPLESS ADMINISTRATION, LAME DUCK. NOW EXPERTS TELL US YES, YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE SANCTIONS, THINGS YOU CAN GET YOUR ARMS AROUND. THAT'S EASY TO SPOT. WHAT YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO SEE, HOWEVER, IS A CYBER POWER THAT AMERICA HAS AND WILL CERTAINLY UTILIZE TO RETALIATE AGAINST THE RUSSIANS.  \n",

IT IS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF WARFARE WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAYS TO MEASURE IT.  >> Reporter: HE'S SAYING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE TO THIS STORY, MUCH OF WHICH WE WILL NOT SEE, ALTHOUGH IT'S ALSO, TO BE FAIR, CERTAIN THAT WE'LL FIND OUT A LOT MORE ABOUT THE RUSSIAN RESPONSE IN THE DAYS TO COME. SANDRA.  >> THANK YOU. JOINING ME NOW WITH MORE POET HOEKSTRA, ADVISER TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM, JULIA RA DIN SKI. CONGRESSMAN, I'LL START WITH YOU FIRST. WHY NOW. ALL SIGNS POINT TO RUSSIA BEHIND THIS. THE RESPONSE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, HE'S THE PRESIDENT WITH JUST A FEW WEEK TO GO. HE'S BEEN THERE FOR EIGHT YEARS. WHAT ABOUT THE TIMING?  >> YOU CAN'T GET INTO BARACK OBAMA'S HEAD ON THIS. THERE'S IN REASON WHY 22 DAYS LEFT IN HIS ADMINISTRATION HE'S MUDDYING THE WATERS AND MAKING THINGS FOR DIFFICULT FOR THE INCOMING PRESIDENT. CONGRATULATION TO DONALD TRUMP. HE'S NOT LETTING THIS DISTRACT HIM. HE'S CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON THE AGENDA THAT HE WANTS TO IMPLEMENT BEGINNING ON JANUARY 20, WHICH IS ABOUT GETTING THE ECONOMY MOVING, DEFEATING ISIS AND REFORMING OR REPEALING OBAMACARE.  >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT A STATEMENT, HE'S SAYING EXACTLY THAT, COME ON, LET'S MOVE ON. LET'S A LOT OF THINGS TO GET TO LIKE THE ECONOMY BUT HE SAYS FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HE WILL SIT DOWN AND FIND OUT THE FACTS FROM INTELLIGENCE.  >> WELL APPARENTLY HE'S BEEN PREEFS ON THE FACTS OR AT LEAST I HOPE HE'S TAKEN BREEFS PEEF B FACT. THAT IS A LITTLE SPEECHLESS CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT HE'S GOT ACCESS TO BRIEFINGS THAT THE REST OF US DON'T HAVE. MOVE ON, MOVE ON FROM THE FACT THAT WE HAD A FOREIGN POWER INFILTRATE AND HACK SOME OF OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, MOVE ON FROM THE FACT THAT THIS COULD EASILY HAPPEN.  >> ARE YOU A FAN, FIRST OF ALL, OF US IMPLEMENTING THE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA AND DO THEY GO FAR ENOUGH?  >> I DON'T THINK THEY GO FAR ENOUGH. BUT I WILL SAY THIS, SHORT OF SEIZING WHATEVER ASSETS WE HAVE IN THE WEST AND THE ABILITY TO SEIZE THAT BELONG TO VLADIMIR PUTIN PERSONALLY AND TO MEMBERS OF HIS INNER CIRCLE THAT CONTROL THE KREMLIN, SHORT OF THATTING WITH NOTHING GOES FAR ENOUGH. IF YOU WANT TO PUNISH VLADIMIR PUT PUTIN, YOU DON'T IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES OR BY KICKING OUT A FEW DIPLOMATS, THAT IS SPECKLES AND WEAK. THE ONLY WAY TO HIT VLADIMIR PUTIN WHERE IT HURTS IS TO GO AFTER HIS POCKETBOOK. I DON'T KNOW IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING THAT BEHIND THE SCENES. BUT IF THEY ARE NOT, THE SANCTIONS DO NOT GO FAR ENOUGH.  >> CHARLIE, THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIA HACKED THE ELECTION ITSELF. THE CIA AND THE FBI BOTH AGREE THAT RUSSIA HACKED JOHN PODESTA. BUT THE ELECTION ITSELF, THERE'S NO PROOF THAT WAS HACKED.  >> KIND OF THE BIG NEWS HERE IS THAT FINALLY PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GETTING UPSET. AND YOU KNOW, WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS VLADIMIR PUTIN AND HIS ALLIES, THEY'RE GASSED PEOPLE, INVADED COUNTRIES, THEY'VE SOUGHT NUCLEAR WEAPONS, DONE WEAPONS TESTS. AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD A PEEP, NOTHING MORE THAN FINGER WAGGING OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION. I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS FINALLY GETTING UPSET WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. I AGREE THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH. BUT I THINK IT'S VERY INSTRUCTIVE THAT, YOU KNOW, NONE OF THESE OTHER THINGS RAISED HIS EYE. WHAT UPSET HIM WAS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN DID SOMETHING, ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION, THAT WENT AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA POLITICALLY AND THAT'S THE ONE LINE YOU CAN'T CROSS WITH THIS GUY. AND BECAUSE THEY WENT AFTER HIM IN A POLITICAL WAY, THEY'RE GOING TO REACT. AND I THINK THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION.  \n",

      ">> CAN I JUST RAISE ONE THING. THE ACT WHICH BARACK OBAMA DID SIGN WENT VERY FAR IN PUNISHING A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN PUTIN'S INNER CIRCLE. I DON'T THINK IT WENT FAR ENOUGH. BUT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE NOT RETALIATED AGAINST THE RUSSIANS FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR IN THE PAST UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT ACCURATE. I THINK OBAMA'S FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO RUSSIA HAS BEEN WOEFUL SO I'M NOT DEFENDING HIS AK ACTIONS.  >> WE HAVE TO SIT AROUND AND SEE WHAT RUSSIA'S RESPONSE IS GOING TO BE. RUSSIA'S FOREIGN MINISTRY, A SPOKESMAN HAS PUT OUT A STATEMENT, SAYING IF RUSSIA TAKES NEW HOSTILE STEPS, IT WILL RECEIVE AN ANSWER. CONGRESSMAN, WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?  >> IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE. IT COULD BE A TIT FOR TAT AND TOMORROW PUTIN WILL EXPEL 36 AMERICANS FROM THE MOSCOW EMBASSY. BUT HE MAY DECIDE THAT HE'S GOING TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF. HE'S LOOKING TOWARDS JANUARY 20, WE WILL HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT. HE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THIS PRESIDENT DOES WITH THE SANCTIONS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS PUT IN PLACE AND BELIEVING THAT MAYBE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A LITTLE BIT OF A FRESH START. REMEMBER, THE OTHER NEWS TODAY IS FOR ABOUT THE LAST FOUR HOURS IT WAS RUSSIA AND TURKEY THAT NEGOTIATED A CEASE-FIRE IN SYRIA, SOMETHING THAT OUR SECRETARY OF STATE AND THIS PRESIDENT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO. THEY WEREN'T EVEN IN THE ROOM WHEN THIS HAPPENED. AND SO PUTIN IS, RIGHT NOW, IS WORKING FROM A POINT OF STRENGTH. I DON'T THINK HE REALLY NEEDS TO GET INTO A TIT FOR TAT WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA ALTHOUGH HE MAY. HE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE THAT.  >> CHARLIE, YOU DO WONDER WHEN HE ULTIMATELY SITS DOWN AND HE SITS DOWN WITH INTELLIGENCE, GETS BRIEFED ON THIS, GETS ALL OF THE FACTS ON THIS, YOU WONDER IF PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IS GOING TO TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY BEEN SKEPTICAL OF WHAT HAS BEEN COMING OUT OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND TO BE QUITE FRANK, CONGRESSMAN, YOU SAID IT'S RIGHT TO BE SO. WILL HE TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD?  >> I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING THAT HE'S GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST LIKE ANY PRESIDENT SHOULD BE SKEPTICAL OF EVERYTHING HE HEARS. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER DONALD TRUMP DECIDES, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING TO TRY TO FORGE A RELATIONSHIP WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN TO FIGHT A GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR. AND THEREFORE PUT ASIDE SOME OF THESE OTHER DISAGREEMENTS. AND IF HE MAKES THAT DECISION, YOU KNOW, HE DID CAMPAIGN ON THAT, THAT IS WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD DO AND HE GOT ELECTED PRESIDENT PROMISING THAT. SO IT MIGHT MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE. IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE TO BE IN BED WITH SOMEBODY LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN. BUT IF THE PRESIDENT SEES THIS BIGGER PICTURE AS A BAY TO GO AFTER THE SCOURGE OF TERRORISM AROUND THE GLOBE, THEN YOU KNOW --  >> AND CYBERSECURITY IS AN ENORMOUS THREAT THAT WE FACE EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND DONALD TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS WHEN HE STEPPED OUTSIDE OF MAR-A-LAGO. HERE'S HIS MOST RECENT RESPONSE TO THAT IF WE CAN LISTEN RIGHT NOW.  >> I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET ON WITH OUR LIVES. I THINK THE COMPUTERS HAVE COMPLICATED LIVES GREATLY. THE WHOLE AGE OF COMPUTER HAS MADE IT WHERE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON. WE'VE GOT SPEED BUT WE HAVEN'T GOT THE SECURITY THAT WE NEED.  >> WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HIS RESPONSE THERE? I MEAN DOES THAT SOUND LIKE HE'S TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AND SEES THIS AS A VERY SERIOUS THREAT?  >> WELL I THINK OVERALL HE SEES CYBERSECURITY AS A VERY SERIOUS THREAT. I MEAN WE KNOW THAT OVER THE LAST FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS, IT'S CHINA, NORTH KOREA, IT'S IRAN, IT'S RUSSIA. THEY'VE ALL BEEN HACKING TOWARDS THE UNITED STATES AND GUESS WHAT, WE'VE BEEN DOING IT THE OTHER WAY AS WELL. I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU GO INTO CYBERSPACE, THE RULES OF WAR IN CYBERSPACE HAVE NOT BEEN CLEARLY DEFINED. SO IF WE RETALIATE, WHAT DO THE RUSSIANS DO TO COME BACK AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. YOU KNOW, IN ALL OTHER AREAS OF WARFARE, THE PARAMETERS ARE UNDERSTOOD BY BOTH SIDES. IN CYBERSPACE IT IS NOT. SO WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL THAT THIS DOES NOT SPIN OUT OF CONTROL AND GO INTO A DIRECTION THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH.  \n",

      ">> IT DOES SEEM THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TRYING TO GET A LOT DONE IN HIS LAST FEW DAYS THAT HE'S IN OFFICE.  >> WELL, LET ME SAY THIS. WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO IS OBVIOUSLY SET IT UP FOR DONALD TRUMP TO NOT BE ABLE TO TRUMP BACK SOME OF THE POSITIONS THAT HE'S DONE. BUT LOOK, THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE JOHN McCAIN AND LINDSEY GRAHAM WHO HAVE BEEN DOING GOD EAST WORK ON THIS SUGGESTING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PUT TOGETHER A PACKAGE OF REAL SANCTIONS WITH REAL TEETH IN IT AND WILL PUT IT OUN THE PRESIDENT'S DESK. THE QUESTION FOR DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE IS HE GOING TO SIDE WITH THE BIPARTISAN GROUP MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ALL OF WHICH AGREE THAT THE RUSSIANS DID HACK INTO THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS OR IS HE GOING TO SIDE WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND LIFT SOME OF THE SANCTIONS AND NOT GO FORWARD WITH THEM. THAT'S THE SITUATION THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS SETTING UP FOR PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP. I WILL ALSO SAY, YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER BACK IN 2000 WHEN GEORGE BUSH LOOKED INTO VLADIMIR PUTIN'S EYES AND SAW HIS SOUL AND THOUGHT HE WAS A FANTASTIC PERSON. HE WAS EXCUSED OF THAT NOTION WHEN RUSSIA WENT INTO GEORGIA. HILLARY CLINTON TRIED TO DO THE RESET BUTTON THINKING HE COULD WORK WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND SHE COULDN'T. DONALD TRUMP WILL LEARN THE SAME THING. HE'S SET UP A TEMPLATE BY WHICH THE WEST IS THE BOOGIE MAN AND HE WILL LEARN THAT QUICKLY AND IF HE DOESN'T IT WILL BE TO HIS DETRIMENT.  >> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FALLING INTO THE TRAP OF JUDGING HIM BEFORE HE'S IN OFFICE.

ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU. LOTS OF NEWS ON THE INTERNATIONAL FRONT AND CERTAINLY KNEES DEVELOP CERTAIN LY THESE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RUSSIA ARE CONCERNING. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP ABOUT THIS?  >> I HAVE. I'VE BEEN WITH HIM MOST OF THE DAY IN MEETINGS INCLUDING ON THIS TOPIC.  >> WHAT ARE HIS THOUGHTS?  >> YOU SEE THEM REFLECTED IN HIS OFFICIAL STATEMENT. HE DOES BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION. ALSO IN THE INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY HE'S AGREED TO RECEIVE INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING NEXT WEEK PROBABLY IN NEW YORK BY A NUMBER OF INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CURRENT SITUATION. AND I THINK THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO BAIT HIM INTO. A BIGGER RESPONSE, I WOULD SAY TWO THINGS TO THEM, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY ONE PRESIDENT AT A TIME AND WE HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW FOR THE NEXT 20 DAY NAMED PRESIDENT BRAUARACK OBAMA. I READ THE SUPPOSITION THAT ONE REASON THAT THE SANCTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE IS TO BOX IN PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP FORCING HIM TO TAKE A POSITION OR OTHERWISE ONCE HE TAKES OFFICE. I MOPE THIS ISN'T MOTIVATED BY POLITICS EVEN A LITTLE BIT. BUT I WOULD NOTE THIS IS GREAT POLITICAL FANFARE AND LARGELY IMSPI SYMB SYMBOLIC. BUT WILL THEY HAVE IMPACT? IT'S UNPRECEDENTED FOR US TO EXPEL THAT MANY OPERATIVES IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE OPERATIVES, THEY DON'T TRAVEL HERE, DON'T KEEP THEIR ASSETS HERE. ONE WONDERS WHAT THE TEETH OF THE SANCTIONS ARE. I SEE THAT RUSSIA AS RETALIATED AGAINST OUR ALLEGED RETALIATION. I THINK THERE EAR CALLING ON CLOSING THE ANGLE AMERICAN SCHOOL IN MOSCOW. THEY PUT OUT A SCATHING STATEMENT THAT THIS IS LAME DUCKS AND POLITICAL CORPSES QUOTE UNQUOTE IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. IT'S CONCERNING AND IT'S ALL NEW. BUT THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WAS BRIEF AND VERY FIRM AND VERY CONSISTENT IN HIS STATEMENT TONIGHT.  >> WHAT DO YOU EXPECT OR FORESEE FOR PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP IN TERMS OF HIS RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA? WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS HE WILL TAKE?  >> THAT'S A LARGER QUESTION APART FROM THESE SANCTIONS AND CERTAINLY APART FROM THE CURRENT ISSUE AT HAND. WE HAVE COMPLICATED RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. WE HAVE FOR DECADES. BUT THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS MADE CLEAR HE'S WILLING TO WORK WITH COUNTRIES WHO WANT TO WORK ON BIG SOLUTIONS. IF THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHO WANT TO COME WITH THE UNITED STATES AND IR RAD KATE ISIS, THEN WE WOULD ENTERTAIN THAT ASSISTANCE DEPENDING ON THE TERMS. IT'S REMARKABLE TO ME THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA JUST SAYING AFT INING I SANCTIONS AGAINST ISRAEL, THAT SECRETARY KERRY LOST A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CREDIBILITY IN UPENDING U.S. POLICY WITH RESPECT TO ISRAEL. YOU WILL SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVING MUCH STRONGER RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL. WE WILL -- YOU CAN'T PUT DAYLIGHT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND ISRAEL DIPLOMATICALLY, MILITARILY, TECHNICALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION. SO I THINK WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS YOU SEE THIS FLURRY OF ACTIVITY BY A TOUGH PRESIDENT OBAMA AS HE EXITS THE OFFICE AND I GUESS HE'S BURNISHING THE LAST COUPLE OF MOMENTS, SEMI COLONS BOTHER OF HIS LEGACY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE NEW PRESIDENT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REEXAMINE OUR RELATIONSHIP GEOPOLITICALLY ACROSS THE GLOBE, MAKING DECISIONS FOR THE AMERICANS.  \n",

JOINING ME NOW, JOHN BOLTON. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM. OBVIOUSLY DISTURBING NEWS AND DEVELOPMENTS ON THE TAIL END OF AN ADMINISTRATION. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS FOR PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP?  >> I DON'T THINK IT BOYFRIENDS H -- BINDS HIM AT ALL. I THINK THE HARDER ISSUE IS DETERMINING WHETHER WE REALLY UNDERSTAND THE FULL EXTENT OF WHAT THE RUSSIAN TWBS CHINESE, THE IRANIANS AND THE KOREANS AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE CYBER WORLD FOR EIGHT YEARS AND BEYOND THAT THAT WE HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO. I THINK WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED TODAY IS INCOHERENT. AND IF THE REPORTS ABOUT WHAT RUSSIA DID ARE IN FACT CORRECT UTTERLY INADEQUATE. I THINK WE NEED A MUCH STRONGER RESPONSE BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET INTO A POSITION WHERE RUSSIA AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO HAS BEEN DOING THIS KIND OF INTERFERENCE IN THE UNITED STATES KNOWS THAT WE CAN CAUSE A LOT MORE PAIN TO THEM THAN THEY CAN CAUSE TO US AND WE CREATE STRUCTURES OF DETERRENCE TO MAKE THEM STOP IT.  >> IF PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS INTERFEREN INTERFERENCE, WHY NOW IS HE DOING THIS AT THE STAGE OF THE GAME WITH VERY IMPOTENT SANCTIONS, IN MY OPINION, LEVIED AGAINST RUSSIA? TO WHAT END?  >> I DON'T THINK WE CAN REALLY SAY. BUT I THINK ONCE JANUARY 20th COMES, OBVIOUSLY TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL BE ABLE TO TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND FIND OUT WHY IT WAS IF THEY WERE SO SURE BACK IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER THIS WAS GOING ON, THEY DIDN'T ANNOUNCE IT THEN. SOME SPECULATED IT'S BECAUSE OBAMA THOUGHT THAT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD WIN THE ELECTION ANY WAY, SO WHY RISK MESSING THAT UP. NOW THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT IT. I CAN'T SAY. BUT I TELL YOU, IT'S NOT JUST RUSSIA, IT'S NOT JUST THE HACK OF THE DNC OR JOHN PODESTA'S E-MAIL, IT'S EIGHT YEARS GOING BACK OF PERSISTENT EFFORTS BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER TO GET INTO OUR GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. LOOK AT THE CHINESE HACK OF OPM PERSONNEL RECORDS, MILLIONS OF RECORDS OF AMERICANS WORKING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BASICALLY STOLEN BY BEIJING. WHAT DID WE DO ABOUT THAT? I DON'T KNOW. APPARENTLY NOTHING.  >> NOTHING. YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS IS A FAR GREATER, SWEEPING PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDR S ADDRESS ADDRESSED. JUST THE DISMAL LACK OF CYBERSECURITY IN THIS COUNTRY IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE AND YOU SEE COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA, LIKE RUSSIA, LIKE THE NORTH KOREANS MAKING A MOCKERY OF THE U.S. SECURITY SYSTEMS AND IT HAS AN IMPACT ON U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY.  >> ABSOLUTELY. I THINK WE'VE GOT A NIS L GAP HERE. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT AMERICA IS CAPABLE OF STRONGER ACTION OFFENSIVELY AND DEFENSIVELY. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT A PRIORITY ON IT UNTIL TODAY. WHEN THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES WEAK AND INEFFECT TICH SANCTIONS SAYING OTHER STEPS WILL BE TAKEN, WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT, HE HAS NO CREDIBILITY IN THAT REGARD. I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T MAKE PUBLIC ACTIONS IN CYBERSPACE OR ELSEWHERE UNTIL THEY'VE HAPPENED. BUT I DO THINK IN ORDER TO, NOT SIMPLY IMPOSE PAIN ON THE RUSSIANS BUT TO SHAME THEM PUBLICLY AS WELL, TO LET THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW, INCLUDING OTHER POTENTIAL HACKERS LIKE BEIJING, THAT IF YOU ACT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES WE WILL IMPOSE SUCH COSTS THAT YOU WILL NOT WANT TO DO IT AGAIN.  >> AND I IMAGINE THAT WILL BE YOUR ADVICE TO PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP AND HE WILL HAVE A MARKEDLY DIFFERENT APPROACH AS IT RELATES TO THE ACTIONS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.

[TALKING AT THE SAME TIME]  >> I HAVE GOT TO GRAB YOU AND PULL YOU BACK IN HERE FOR A SECOND.  >> YEAH.  >> I THINK DONALD TRUMP IF ANYTHING HAS BEEN DOWN PLAYING IT WHEREAS MOST OF US ON THE RIGHT HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS HAPPEN. YOU TALK ABOUT ISRAEL AND RUSSIA AND TALK ABOUT THE OIL AND GAS BANNING ALL DRILLING, IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS THROWING A LOT OF STUFF AT TRUMP RIGHT BEFORE HE LEAVES.  >> YEAH. BUT HE IS STILL THE PRESIDENT. THIS SPARST THE PACE OF GOVERNANCE. THIS IS HOW IT ALL WORKS. LOOK, THE REAL ISSUE HERE, RIGHT, ALL THE STUFF IS GOING TO GO AWAY IN A FEW WEEKS. JOHN MCCAIN IS GOING TO HAVE HEARINGS NEXT WEEK ON THE RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE. AND I THINK WHAT WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT, ERIC, IN A FEW WEEKS, IS TRUMP'S REFUSAL TO JOIN IN PEOPLE LIKE PAUL RYAN, JOHN MCCAIN, MARCO RUBIO, LINDSEY GRAHAM IN RECOGNIZING HOW SERIOUS THIS RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION HAS BEEN. THIS HAS BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTING TO ME.  >> I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU MENTIONED, THOSE REPUBLICANS YOU MENTIONED ARE LOOKING FOR MORE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. SARAH, I WILL ASK YOU. IS PRESIDENT OBAMA TRYING TO PUSH THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KIND OF ANTI-TRUMP LEADING UP TO THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY?  >> WELL, I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT BARACK OBAMA WOULDN'T BE TAKING THESE ACTIONS IF HILLARY CLINTON WERE ABOUT TO GIVE HER INAUGURAL ADDRESS. THIS IS ABOUT PROTECTING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEGACY. HE IS DEEPLY CONCERNED NOW THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL COME IN AND DO WHAT HE PROMISED, WHICH TO UNDO ALL OF THESE DISASTROUS REGULATIONS, POLICIES, FOREIGN POLICY IN PARTICULAR WHO IS TRYING TO THROW DUST IN THE IDENTITY THEFT TRANSITION TEAM WHILE THEY ARE TRYING TO ASSEMBLE A GOVERNMENT. NOW THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS CHAOS ON JANUARY 20TH TO DEAL WITH. BY THE WAY, THIS WASN'T A SMALL AND MINOR THING TO ISRAEL. THIS IS EXISTENTIAL TO ISRAEL. THIS IDEA THAT THESE ARE SMALL NITPICKY THINGS IS JUST UNTRUE.  \n",

      "IN THE IMPACT SEGMENT TONIGHT, WHAT WILL PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP DO ABOUT RUSSIA AS DOZENS OF RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS SCRAMBLED TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES AFTER BEING GIVEN THE BOOT BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, DONALD TRUMP STILL SEEMS TO BE TAKING A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH TO HOW HE WANT TO HANDLE CHARGES HOW RUSSIA HACKED OUR ELECTIONS. HERE IS WHAT REINCE PRIEBUS TOLD US ON THE FACTOR LAST NIGHT.  >> THE PRESIDENT-ELECT PUT OUT A STATEMENT AND HE SAID, LOOK, IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS. ALSO, NEVERTHELESS, WE'RE GOING TO BE MEETING AND HE IS GOING TO BE MEETING WITH INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS NEXT WEEK TO TALK ABOUT THIS REPORT AND FIND OUT THE DETAILS OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, HOW THE INVESTIGATION TOOK PLACE. AND MAYBE AT THAT TIME OUR MAYBE LATER EAGLE HAVE A RESPONSE. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST NOT IN THE POSITION TO SIT HERE AND RESPOND TO ALL OF THESE DETAILS BEFORE WE HAVE A FULL BLOWN INTELLIGENCE REPORT ON THIS PARTICULAR MATTER.  >> BUT MANY OBSERVERS SAY THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR AS DAY.  >> 17 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE RUSSIANS ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS. THAT IS TERRIFYING. AND WHAT'S EVEN MORE TERRIFYING IS THAT THE INCOMING PRESIDENT WANTS TO MOVE ON FROM THIS ENORMOUS GEOPOLITICAL RISK AND DOMESTIC RISK TO THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS REALLY SCARY.  >> AND MR. TRUMP MAY FIND OPPOSITION FROM BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IF HE TRIES TO REVERSE THE PRESIDENT'S SANCTIONS AS MANY LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THINK THEY WERE LONG OVERDUE. JOINING US FROM JACKSONVILLE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN RON DESAN TIS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. AND FROM PAL AT TOE SOCIETYBERG. DEPUTY ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT CLINTON. BOTH OF YOU BEFORE I ASK YOU A QUESTION I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR. THIS IS A DEBATE WE KEEP HAVING. EVERYONE BELIEVES IF RUSSIA DID IN FACT HACK AND EFFECT THE OUTCOME OF OUR ELECTIONS IT'S A BAD THING AND THEY NEED TO BE SANCTIONED. I WILL START WITH YOU, CONGRESSMAN, DON'T WE NEED TO HAVE THE HARD PROOF, THE EVIDENCE FIRST?  >> WELL, I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ACCUSED OF. THEY DID NOT HACK INTO OUR VOTING SYSTEMS. THEY HACKED PEOPLE'S EMAILS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS LIKE JOHN PODESTA. IT'S IMPORTANT, IT'S NOTEWORTHY. BUT IT REALLY FOLLOWS A LONG STRING OF CYBER SECURITY ATTACKS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN LAUNCHING, THAT THEIR AGENTS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHING AGAINST OUR GOVERNMENT, AGAINST BUSINESSES FOR YEARS AND YEARS. AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST AS HE IS LEAVING OFFICE, PRESIDENT OBAMA ISSUES SANCTIONS WHICH I THINK REALLY DON'T AMOUNT TO MUCH BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THOSE ENTITIES, MANY OF THOSE ENTITIES DON'T EVEN HAVE U.S. HOLDINGS. I THINK THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THE SANCTIONS WILL PROBABLY BE VERY SMALL. I THINK IT'S MORE OF A SYMBOLIC ACT BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF OUTCRY FROM MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THERE IS AN ATTEMPT TO TIE WHAT RUSSIA DID TO DONALD TRUMP'S VICTORY SAYING THAT IF RUSSIA HADN'T DONE THAT SOMEHOW HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE PRESIDENT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S ACCURATE. BUT I DO THINK WE SHOULD HOLD RUSSIA ACCOUNTABLE.  >> AND I THINK WE ALL DO. SO, AMBASSADOR, YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE SANCTIONS SO FAR I WILL PARAPHRASE HERE, VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS BASICALLY SAID YEAH, WHATEVER. AND PROMISED NOT TO RETALIATE RIGHT AWAY.  >> WELL, I THINK PRESIDENT PUTIN IS HOPING THAT HE WILL GET A SWEET DEAL FROM THE INCOMING PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP. WHICH I DON'T THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THIS WILL BE A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT THAT WE HAD TO STAND UP TO BLATANT INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION PRO-SELECTIVE LEAKING, TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION AND HURT HILLARY CLINTON. QUI DON' -- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION HOW IT AFFECTED BUT BLATANT INVASION OF OUR SOVEREIGNTY AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT OBAMA IS HAS TAKEN THE RIGHT ACTION. I THINK IT WILL STAND. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL LOOK AT IT BUT CLEARLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I WISH IT HAD HAPPENED EARLIER. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SANGSD RUSSIA. THERE WERE TOUGH SANCTIONS WHEN THEY INVADED CRIMEA. IT'S A BY TART SAN ISSUE. IF PRESIDENT TRUMP DECIDES TO TRY TO LIFT THAT HE WILL HAVE A VERY QUICK BILL IN CONGRESS PASSED WITH A VETO-PROOF MARGIN. THESE SANCTIONS WILL STAY.  \n",

      ">> CONGRESSMAN, LISTEN, I SAW LIND SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM AND JOHN MCCAIN SAY THEY WERE GOING TO LEAD THE NEXT PUSH IN CONGRESS TO LEAD THE SANCTIONS BEFORE THEY KNOW IN FACT WHAT EVIDENCE THAT THE 17 AGENCIES ALLEGEDLY HAVE.  >> WELL, YEAH, AND THEN I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT, I MEAN, RUSSIA HAS TAKEN SO MANY ACTIONS DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY ADVERSE TO OUR INTERESTS. THEY SENT ADVANCED AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS TO IRAN. THEY MADE INCURSIONS INTO THE UKRAINE. THEY HARBORED EDWARD SNOWDEN WHO GAVE UP A WHOLE BUNCH OF STATE SECRETS. SO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION REALLY DID VERY LITTLE TO COMBAT A LOT OF THAT SO NOW GOING OUT THE DOOR, HE IS TRYING TO DO. THIS SO, CONGRESS, LOOK, WE'RE GOING TO D DEAL WITH IT STRONG SUPPORT FOR HOLDING RUSSIA ACCOUNTABLE. I WOULD NOTE ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID IN THIS PAST CONGRESS WAS AUTHORIZE LETHAL AID FOR UKRAINE. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID NOT WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD.  >> AMBASSADOR, I'M SCRATCHING MY HEAD A LITTLE WIT. BIT. THE SANCTIONS WERE EXPEL 35 DIPLOMATS AND CLOSE DOWN TWO WHAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE CONSULATES OR EMBASSIES THAT THEY FIGURE THERE MAY BE SPYING GOING ON. I'M SCRATCHING MY HEAD BECAUSE I'M WONDERING WHY WE DIDN'T DO IT 8 YEARS AGO OR SIX YEARS AGO OR WHEN WE ACTUALLY DID KNOW IT.  >> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK WE HAVE TAKEN VERY TOUGH STANCE AGAINST RUSSIA THROUGHOUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. I THINK THE ODD THING HERE IS WHY DONALD TRUMP THINKS THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN IS A GOOD LEADER. HE IS A THUG THAT'S BASICALLY DESTROYING HIS OWN DEMOCRACY AND THREATENING HIS NEIGHBORS. AND I WILL PUT MONEY ON THE FACT THAT EARLY ON IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PRESIDENT PUTIN WILL TEST HIM. MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING WITH NATO. MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING WITH THE BALTICS. BALL BAL BALTICS. I THINK IN A WAY STEP BY PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A GIFT TO THE INCOMING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE TO ACT ON IT RIGHT AWAY. HE CAN SAY IT'S HAPPENING. HE MAY THINK HE WANTS TO LIFT THOSE SANCTIONS AND HIS NEW SECRETARY OF STATE IS ON RECORD AS NOT LIKING SANCTIONS. I THINK THEY ARE PROPORTIONAL MEASURE TO A VERY BLATANT HACKING OF OUR ELECTION SEASON SYSTEM. THE IMPACT WE WON'T EVER KNOW. I THINK IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE STANCE TO GO BACK AND SAY PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS NOT STOOD UP TO RUSSIA IS JUST SIMPLY DOESN'T RELATE TO THE FACTS REPEATEDLY SANCTIONED THEM.  >> THE REASON WHY THAT DIALOGUE OR THAT DEBATE IS GOING AROUND IS BECAUSE OF THE TWO THINGS. WHEN HE SENT HILLARY CLINTON, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SENT HILLARY CLINTON OVER THERE, AND PROMISED A RE-SET WITH THE RUSSIANS AND THEN LATER ON WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA HIMSELF SAID HEY, LISTEN, AFTER RE-ELECTION, WHEN I HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY, WE CAN WORK SOME THINGS OUT. IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THERE WERE A LOT OF TEETH IN THE ACTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA. LET ME ASK THE CONGRESSMAN THIS THOUGH. THE DIFFERENCE GOING FORWARD IS RUSSIA'S ECONOMY IS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE. OIL PRICES HAVE ALMOST RUINED RUSSIA. THEY ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO GET VERY TOUGH WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP AND WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO, IN FACT?  >> YEAH, AND MY ADVICE TO DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE LOOK AT HOW OBAMA REALLY BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO TRY TO BE NICE TO RUSSIA. HOW THEY BASICALLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT UNDERSTAND PUTIN'S PSYCHOLOGY. IF YOU'RE STRONG AND YOU'RE FORTH RIGHT WITH HIM. I THINK WE CAN GENERATE BETTER OUTCOMES. I THINK WHEN HE SEES WEAKNESS, THAT'S WHAT HE PREYS UPON. IN THE START OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ONE OF THE TWO THINGS HE DID IN 2009 WAS REMOVE OUR MISSILE DEFENSES FROM EASTERN EUROPE. THAT SENT A SIGNAL AND I THINK PUTIN ACTED ACCORDINGLY EVER SINCE. AMBASSADOR?  >> I JUST DON'T THINK THAT DOES NOT COMPORT WITH FACTS AND DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO TRY IT A RE-SET AND FIND IT DOESN'T WORK EITHER. THE RUSSIAN POLICY WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN STRONG DEFENDING OUR INTEREST.  >> WHY ARE YOU SO NEGATIVE ON THIS. WHAT'S YOUR INDICATION, I MEAN, DONALD TRUMP --  >> -- NEGATIVE ON WHAT?  >> ON THE INCOMING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. YOU SAID VLADIMIR PUTIN IS GOING TO TEST HIM. HE DIDN'T TEST OBAMA.  >> FOR DONALD TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY PRAISED VLADIMIR PUTIN, WHO HAS INVADED TWO OF HIS NEIGHBORS, LOCKED UP OPPOSITION, ASSASSINATED HIS OPPOSITION AND IS A THREAT TO MANY OF THE UNITED STATES INTERESTS IN THAT REGION. WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH WITH THEM AND THAT'S WHAT OBAMA HAS DONE. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN TRY AND RE-SET THE RELATIONS BUT REALITY WILL QUICKLY.  \n",

YOU ARE HELPING ME OUT HERE.  >> ALT RIGHT. I MEAN.  >> IT WENT ON AND ON.  >> EVERY WEEK THERE IS A DIFFERENT THEME.

THAT THIS NOTION THAT THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL AND THAT PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IS NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS AND NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THIS? WHEN 17 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS?  >> RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE. 17 AGENCIES HAD TALKED ABOUT THIS. HAVE NOT SHOWN THE PROOF OR THE EVIDENCE.  >> THAT'S MY POINT.  >> 13 PAGE DOCUMENT FROM THE FBI WAS JUST RELEASED.  >> I SAW IT, I READ IT.  >> YOU READ IT, SO THEN YOU KNOW.  >> NO.

HAS IT BEEN DISMISSED BY THE PARTIES THAT WERE INJURED? JOHN PODESTA, THE DNC? NO, IT HAS NOT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOU COULD NOT LIKE THE SOURCE OR WHERE IT CAME FROM, BUT IT WAS NEWS WORTHY STUFF. WE HAD INFORMATION IN THERE THAT SHOWED THAT THE DNC WAS TRYING TO DESTROY THE CAMPAIGN OF BERNIE SANDERS. WE HAD DONNA BRAZILE WHEN SHE WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF CNN SHARING DEBATE QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE.

YOU THINK HE IS A WHISTLE BLOWER. I THINK HE IS SOMEBODY WHO SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR WHAT HE DID IN TERMS OF TURNING OVER THE SECRETS THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND RELEVANT AS IT RELATES TO NATIONAL SECURITY HERE. SO THEN THE QUESTION REMAINS HOW DOES PRESIDENT OBAMA SEE IT OBVIOUSLY A PETITION FORWARD TO GET REPRIEVE PRIOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EMINENT DEPARTURE. I THINK HE IS GOING TO HAVE A VERY TOUGH TIME JUSTIFYING PARDONING SNOWDEN. KEEP IN MIND SNOWDEN RAN TO RUSSIA.

WE WILL NOT CREATE PROBLEMS FOR U.S. DIPLOMATS. WE WILL NOT EXPEL ANYONE. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER OBSERVING THAT THE RUSSIAN STRONG MAN ISN'T KEEPING HIS FEELINGS ABOUT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT IS SECRET.  >> PUTIN IS SHOWING HIS COMPLETE CONTEMPT FOR OBAMA, THE WAY IT LAUGHS IT OFF. IT'S A SMART MOVE ON THE PART OF THE RUSSIANS. YOU PUT NO PRESSURE ON TRUMP AND GIVE HIM THE OPTION TO DROP THE SANCTIONS. THESE SANCTIONS ARE MEANINGLESS.  >> WE'LL HAVE REACTION FROM GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE ON HOW THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION SHOULD HANDLE THIS. FIRST WE GO TO PETER DOOCY IN FLORIDA WITH MORE ON PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP'S ANSWER.  >>  >> Reporter: ONE OF HIS TOP PRIORITIES IN THE FIRST WEEK OF THE NEW YEAR IS TO GREAT BRIEFED BY HIGH RANKING OFFICIALS ABOUT THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE THAT MAKES THEM SO SURE IT WAS RUSSIA AND NOT SOMEBODY ELSE TRYING TO IMPACT THE NOVEMBER RESULT. MR. TRUMP AGREED TO HEAR THESE OFFICIALS OUT A DAY AFTER DISMISSING INTEL ABOUT RUSSIA INSISTING INSTEAD THAT IN THE AGE OF COMPUTERS NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON. AND JUST WEEKS AFTER HE SAID PEOPLE PUSHING A STORY LINE ABOUT RUSSIAN HACKERS TRYING TO THROW THE ELECTION IN HIS FAVOR WERE EMBARRASSED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S LOSS, TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT AWAY. TRANSITION OFFICIALS SAID THIS MORNING THAT THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS NO PLANS TO PRIVATELY REACH OUT TO MR. PUTIN ABOUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S PUNISHMENT UNTIL AFTER HE GETS THE INTEL BRIEFING NEXT WEEK. BUT HE HAS PUBLICLY REACHED OUT TO THE RUSSIAN LEADER GIVING HIM A HAT TIP FOR PLEDGING NOT TO RETALIATE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES UNTIL HE TAKES THE TEMPERATURE OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT'S ATTITUDE TOWARD HIM TWEETING, GREAT MOVE BY DELAY ON PUT PUTIN. I ALWAYS KNEW HE WAS SMART. MR. TRUMP DOESN'T NEED BRIEFINGS DAILY BECAUSE THEY OFTEN CONTAIN THE SAME THING BACK TO BACK BUT HE SAYS HE GETS THEM WHEN HE NEEDS THEM BASED ON GUIDANCE FROM HIS STAFF. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE ON HIS STAFF TOLD HIM HE NEEDS TO BE BRIEFED ABOUT ELECTION INTERFERENCE. THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHO WILL BE BRIEFING MR. TRUMP OVER THE WEEKEND OR THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK.  >> THANK YOU. TODAY'S REACTION FROM PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT PUTIN SUGGESTS THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF AFFECTION BETWEEN THE TWO MEN BUT THEIR FRIENDLY BACK AND FORTH COMES AT THE SAME TIME SOME OF MR. TRUMP'S ADVISERS ARE RECOMMENDING A CYNICAL APPROACH IN DEALING WITH RUSSIA.  >> THIS HAS ALL OF THE EARMARKS OF A PLOY. I MEAN THE WAY THIS WAS SET UP, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV IS REPORTED PUBLICLY TO PROPOSE TO PUTIN THAT RUSSIA EXPEL 35 DIPLOMATS. THEY REPORT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND THEN VLADIMIR PUTIN SAYS NO, WITH NO, WE WON'T DO THAT. WHAT A SWEETHEART.

COULD PRESIDENT PUTIN'S RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT BE A PLOY?  >> HE'S IGNORING OBAMA. HE'S DOING SOMETHING THAT REALLY DOES THE ONE THING NO LEADER WANTS TO HAVE HAPPEN AND THAT IS TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY, TO BE IGNORED, TO BE TREATED CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND THAT IS WHAT PUTIN IS DOING TO OBAMA. AND BY SAVING HIS PRAISE FOR TRUMP, HE'S SAYING THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF COMING TO TOWN, WE'LL DEAL WITH IMH. THIS GUY OBAMA IS IRRELEVANT. THAT'S A STRATEGIC MOVE ON PUTIN'S PART. HE'S NO FRIEND TO THE UNITED STATES AND HE'S NOT LOOKING AFTER OUR BEST INTEREST. BUT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT LOOKING AT RUSSIA'S BEST INTEREST. THESE ARE TWO SMART GUYS SIZING EACH OTHER UP IN THE RING BUT I BELIEVE THEY BRING TO THE TABLE SOMETHING THAT PUTIN DID NOT HAVE FOR OBAMA AND THEY IS THEY HAVE RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER. I DON'T THINK PUTIN HAS ANY RESPECT FOR OBAMA.  >> WELL, AMBASSADOR BOLTON, HE'S SUGGESTING THAT THE SAME-SEXES TH -- SANCTIONS SHOULD BE TOUGHER AND THAT STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES. DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM, HE'S SAYING IF WHAT IS ALLEGED IS TRUE ABOUT THE HACKING THAT THE SANCTIONS SHOULD BE TOUGHER, DO YOU AGREE?  >> SURE. I THINK IT'S FINE. GO AHEAD AND PUT SOME TOUGH SANCTIONS ON. LET ME JUST ASK THIS QUESTION. DOES ANYBODY REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES ISN'T ATTEMPTING TO HACK THE RUSSIANS, THE IRANIANS, THE CHINESE, THE NORTH KOREANS. AND IF WE'RE NOT, WE'RE STUPID. OF COURSE WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT. WE HAVEN'T BEEN CAUGHT. AND IF WE GET CAUGHT I'M SURE WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME OUTRAGE AMONG THOSE NATIONS. THE ONE THING I THINK THAT IS BEING MISSED HERE IS THAT EVERY NATION IS TRYING TO HACK OTHER NATIONS. IT'S PART OF CYBERSECURITY. BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT CHANGED THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT A VERY DUMB DEMOCRAT GAVE HIS PASSWORD AWAY TO THE HACKERS, WHATEVER THEY WERE AND HILLARY CLINTON DESTROYED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS AND KEPT A WHOLE LOT OF STATE SECRETS ON A PRIVATE SERVER IN HER BATHROOM WHICH WAS UNSECU D UNSECURED. THAT COULD BE THE FOCUS OF A LOT OF ATTENTION.  >> YOU'VE SAID THAT EVERY CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD, THIS DIDN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ELECTION. IS THAT IMPORTANT? AMBASSADOR BOLTON MAKES THE POINT THAT THE RUSSIAN EFFORTS BEING INCOMPETENT OR INSUFFICIENT SHOULDN'T MAKE US FEEL BETTER. IT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT HAD AN IMPACT OR ANY EFFECT ON U.S. ELECTIONS.  >> I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO SAY, LOOK, THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO TOLERATE IT EVEN WHILE WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO IT TO YOU. I GET THAT. THAT'S PART OF THE POSTERING AND THE DIPLOMATIC MOVE THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE. THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR US TO EXPLORE THE HOLES IN OUR CYBERSECURITY DEFENSES AND MAYBE THE GREAT FOCUS, INSTEAD OF PUTTING OM SANCTION ON RUSSIA, ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT, MAYBE THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE EXPENDING OUGHT TO BE TO PLUG THE HOLES IN OUR CYBERSECURITY VURNL RAB VULNERABILITIES. I DON'T HEAR THE OUTRAGE ABOUT HOW DARE THESE PEOPLE GET BY BECAUSE WE WERE WEAK IN OUR DEFENSES AND HAD BIG HOLES IN IT. IN THE CASE OF PODESTA, IT WASN'T A BIG HOLE OR CYBERSECURITY. MY GOSH, THE MAN GAVE HIM THE PASSWORD. HE WAS SPOOFED AND HE TOOK THE BAIT. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE WIKILEAKS. IF IT WAS THE RUSSIANS. EVEN THOUGH ASSANGE SAID IT WASN'T THE RUSSIANS.  \n",

      "ADVISERS TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AREN'T THE ONLY ONE TO SUGGEST THAT PUTIN IS ENGAGE IN A PLOY. THE ARTICLE IN THE DAILILY BEAS RAISES MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT'S INTENTIONS WITH A HEADLINE THAT READS, QUOTE, PUTIN OUTFOXED OBAMA, LIES IN WAIT FOR TRUMP. I'M JOINED NOW BY KATRINA PEARSON, SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE KMEK TIF DIRECTOR OF THE FOUNDATION FOR CHILDREN. KATRINA, MOSCOW LAUGHS OFF THE OBAMA AMOUDMINISTRATION'S SANCTS AND PROMISES TO RESPOND IN KIND. QUITE AN ARTICLE. I MEAN IS PUTIN LAYING A TRAP FOR TRUMP?  >> OF COURSE THE RUSSIANS ARE MOCKING PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE HAS 21 DAYS LEFT AS PRESIDENT AN ALL OF THE SUDDEN IT'S TIME TO PUNISH THE RUSSIANS? IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT THE ONLY REASON VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS RISEN TO THE LEVEL OF POWER TODAY IS BECAUSE OF THE FOREIGN POLICY IMPOTENCE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. WE DIDN'T SEE NEARLY THIS OUTRAGE WHEN THE RUSSIANS WERE INVOLVED IN UKRAINE OR CRIMEA OR SYRIA. BUT SUDDENLY NOW THAT E-MAILS HAVE BEEN LEAKED, IT'S A PROBLEM.  >> KEVIN ADDRESS THE TIMING. THE TIMING IS WHAT EVERYBODY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IN THE WEAK WAKE OF ALL OF THIS. IF THEY KNEW THIS FOR MONTHS. CHAIRMAN McCALL WAS TELLING OBAMA DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS MONTHS AGO. WHY ARE THEY ACTING NOW? IT'S A DIFFICULT ANSWER.  >> YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I WOULD AGREE THAT ON ONE SQUARE YOU COULD SAY THIS MAY BE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE IN TERMS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING YOU SAID WITH GOVERNOR HUCKABEE. IT'S NOT THE IMPACT OF THE HACKING, IT'S THE FACT. WHEN RUSSIA DECIDED TO ENGAGE IN ESPIONAGE AND INTERFERE WITH OUR ELECTIONS, IT HAD A BIG IMPACT THAT PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT. BUT THE MERE FACT THAT THEY'RE DOING IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. AMERICA IS REALLY UNEASY WITH THE COZINESS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS WITH PUTIN. AND ONE THING WE NEED TO LOOK AT IS NOT JUST FIGHTING AMONG OURSELVES ABOUT THIS, BUT MAKING SURE WE ENGAGE IN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF GOING AFTER RUSSIA OURSELVES.  >> TO BE SURE, KEVIN, HE MADE THESE COMMENTS ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND WAS THEN ELECTED PRESIDENT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WEREN'T TOO UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP. I WANT TO THROW TO THIS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS PROMISING OUTGOING RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ABOUT MORE FLEXIBILITY, THIS WAS BACK IN 2012, YOU'LL REMEMBER IT WHEN YOU SEE IT.  >> AFTER MY ELECTION I HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY. [ INAUDIBLE ]  >> AND TO REMEMBER, PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS LEANING IN AND SAID THERE, THIS IS MY LAST ELECTION. AFTER MY ELECTION I HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY. KATRINA, LOOK BACK, REFLECT TO THAT MOMENT IN 2012 TO TODAY.  >> THAT'S TO MY FIRST POINT. LOOK AT WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE GLOBALLY. THAT'S WHY NO ONE IS TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY. TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION IS THIS A TRAP, IS VLADIMIR PUTIN PLAYING DONALD TRUMP IN SOME WEIRD WAY. THE ANSWER TO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT. IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST FOR THE RUSSIANS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN COME TO THE TABLE WITH A NEUTRAL SLATE WITH A PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WORK OUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE GLOBALLY, THE BEST INTEREST OF BOTH NATIONS. VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS TO APPEAR EXTREMELY POWERFUL TO HIS PEOPLE AND HE KNOWS TWO THINGS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. NUMBER ONE, HE KNOWS THAT LEADING FROM BEHIND IS NOT IN THE TRUMP DNA. AND NUMBER TWO, THERE WILL BE NO SUCH THING AS AN EMERGENCY RED LINE IN THE SAND. SO I SUSPECT THAT THESE TWO POWERFUL MEN WILL COME TOGETHER AND HOPEFULLY DO VERY GOOD THINGS FOR THE COUNTRY.  \n",

I'M JOINED BY KIRSTEN ANDERSON AND MOLLY HEMINGWAY. SO KRISTEN, I'LL START WITH YOU FIRST. ELECTION SCANDALS, THE THEMES THAT DOMINATED 2016. WHAT DID WE SEE?  >> IN 2016 PEOPLE REALLY STARTED TWEETING ABOUT THE ELECTION AFTER THE CONVENTIONS HAPPENED. AND IT WAS THE ISSUE OF WIKILEAKS, THE JOHN PODESTA E-MAILS, THE DNC E-MAILS, DRIP DRIP DRIP OF THINGS REVEALED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER TEAM AND THEIR INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS THAT REALLY BECAME A DOMINANT THEME IN THIS ELECTION.  >> WE'RE LOOKING AT A CHART OF THE DATA AND THE BIG BLUE LINE AT THE TOP, THAT'S WIKILEAKS HACKING. AND CLINTON'S E-MAIL CAME IN SECOND. YOU CAN SEE THE DOMINATION OF THOSE ELECTION SCANDALS AND GAPS CLEARLY.  >> THERE WERE OTHER DEBATES, YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE TRUMP UNIVERSITY AND THESE MOMENTS, JUDGE CURIAL, DONALD TRUMP TOOK A LOT OF HEAT. AND WE DON'T FIND THE TWITTER CHATTER ABOUT THOSE ISSUES SPREAD VERY FAR BEYOND SORT OF BELTWAY ELITES, INSIDERS, FOLKS WHO WERE FANS OF HILLARY CLINTON. THE STORIES THAT GOT THE MOST MAINSTREAM APPEAL AND DISCUSSION WERE ONES THAT WERE ABOUT EITHER HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS OR E-MAILS THAT HAS BEEN HACKED FROM THE DNC OR JOHN PODESTA.  >> THAT WASN'T GOOD NEWS FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO SEE THAT HER E-MAILS WERE DOMINATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA.  >> IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE ON THE NORMAL MEDIA THAT YOU WOULD HAVE INFORMATION ON TWITTER AND ELSEWHERE PEOPLE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN CLINTON SCANDAL. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN IND KAR INDICATOR THAT PEOPLE WERE DISSATISFIED WITH HILLARY CLINTON, THE WIKILEAKS OR EVEN ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THIS RESEARCH SHOWS IS JUST HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT COMMENT ABOUT DEPLORABLES AND IRREDEEMABLE AMERICANS WAS, WHICH WE'VE LATER LEARNED FROM PEOPLE INSIDE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THEY AWL ALLSW IT WAS A BIG DEAL. YOU CAN LEARN HOW PEOPLE ARE DISCUSSING IN THEIR NORMAL HABITAT WHAT ACTUALLY CAPTURES PEOPLE.  >> I WANT TO GET TO THE DATA. IT'S FASCINATING. YOU LOOK AT THE ELECTION AND THE CANDIDATES AND THEIR SHARE OF THE CONVERSATION. THE REDDISH PINK AREA IS DONALD TRUMP DOMINATING THE CONVERSATION. HILLARY CLINTON IN THE BLUE. WHAT A TELLING STORY THAT WAS.  >> DONALD TRUMP WAS THE NUMBER ONE TOPIC AMONG BELTWAY INSIDERS, AMONG CONSERVATIVES, AMONG LIBERALS, AMONG OR AUDIENCE OF EVERYONE. NORMALLY IT'S NOT A GOOD THING NORMALLY TO BE THE MOST DISCUSSED TOPIC ON TWITTER. WE SEE FOR CONSERVATIVES, HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE TOP, FOR LIBERALS, DONALD TRUMP OR FOR REPUBLICAN, JEB BUSH. BUT DONALD TRUMP DOMINATED EVERYTHING. WHEN OTHER THING YOU'LL NOTICE IN THE CHARTS IS THE DISCUSSION WAS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING AND EVOLVING. THERE WAS ALWAYS A DIFFERENT TOPIC. FOR CLINTON IT WAS THE E-MAILS THROUGH AND THROUGH.  >> THE DATA WAS DIVIDED UP, ELECTION, NONELECTION TOPICS. THIS IS BEYOND THE ELECTION, THE STORIES THAT DEFINED THE YEAR. ALL RIGHT. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT THE SPIKE IS ON THE FAR END. IN THE LATER MONTHS OF THE YEAR, THE CUBS WINNING THE WORLD SERIES, THANK YOU. CHICAGO GIRL. I CONFESS. THAT WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE STORIES THAT DEFINED THE YEAR. THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. GOOD THE SEE YOU.  \n",

      "WELCOME TO \"HANNITY.\" RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS RESPONDING TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IMPOSING SANCTIONS ON HIS COUNTRY OVER ALLEGATIONS OF HACKING. I'M KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE IN TONIGHT FOR SEAN. PUTIN RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETALIATE WE WILL NOT RESORT TO IRRESPONSIBLE KITCHEN DIPLOMACY BUT PLAN OUR FURTHER STEPS TO RESTORE RUSSIAN RELATIONS BASED ON THE POLICIES OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AND PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP IS REACTING TO PUTIN'S STATEMENT BY TWEETING, QUOTE, GREAT MOVE ON THEY BY V. PUTIN. I ALWAYS KNEW HE WAS VERY SMART. JOINING ME NOW, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR JOHN BOLTON. THANKS FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. LOTS OF DEVELOPMENTS EVEN SINCE YESTERDAY WHEN WE SPOKE ON THIS SHOW. LET'S GET YOUR THOUGHTS.  >> WELL, I THINK THE PUTIN DECISION NOT TO EXPEL AMERICAN DIPLOMATS HAS SEVERAL ASPECTS TO IT. IT SHOWS UTTER CONTEMPT FOR BARACK OBAMA. IT SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO BE HISTORY IN THREE WEEKS AND I'LL RESERVE JUDGMENT ON WHAT I'M GOING TO DO UNTIL YOU'RE GONE. HE HASN'T SAID THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO EXPEL AMERICAN B DIPLOMATS. HE'S PUTTING IT OFF. THIS WAS STAGED. TH SO EARLY IN THE DAY RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV GO PUBLIC WITH A RECOMMENDATION TO EXPEL 35 AMERICAN DIPLOMATS. EVERY WESTERN NEWS SOURCE IN MOS KPOU REPORTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE EXPELLED AND THEN VLADIMIR PUTIN STEPS IN SAYING, NO, NO, WE WON'T EXPEL THE DIPLOMATS AND I'M INVITING THE CHILDREN OF AMERICAN DIPLOMATS TO AN EASTERN ORTHODOX CHRISTMAS PARTY. WHAT A SWEETHEART. HE'S TRYING TO MANEUVER TO RUSSIAN'S ADVANTAGE. NO MISTAKE THERE B. BUT HE'S TRYING TO BUILD THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER TO GET WHAT I THINK HE REALLY WANTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCESSION HE WANTS IS NO RETALIATION FOR THE CYBERATTACK. THE SANCTIONS ARE MEANINGLESS. THE EXPULSION OF DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL IS A TEMPORARY PROBLEM. WHAT HE REALLY WORRIES ABOUT IS AMERICA GOING ON CYBER OFFENSE IN RETALIATION TO WHAT HE APPARENTLY DID DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN. SO THIS IS, THIS IS FILL VERY MU MUCH IN PLAY.  >> YOU BRING UP AN IMPORTANT POINT. HE DOESN'T WANT THE FOCUS TO BE ON THE CYBERATTACKS. THIS IS A WAY OF SIDE STEPPING IT. THIS IS A MAN WHO'S OBVIOUSLY VERY BRIGHT, KGB, HE KNOWS WHAT HIS MISSION OBJECTIVES ARE, HE'S FOCUSED ON THE TARGET AND HE'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ACHIEVE IT. AND THAT MEANS IF ULT VATING THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH DONALD TRUMP, HE'S GOING TO DO THAT. AND IT'S VERY MUCH SHOWING DISRESPECT FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IN THE LAST THREE WEEK TO SAY THAT WAS A JOKE. YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO POKE THE CAGE OF RUSSIA, OF MOSCOW AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK.  >> AND I THINK IT SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE THOUGHT THROUGH WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IN THESE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. THEY SAW WHAT OBAMA DID TO IZ Z ISRAEL AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT OBAMA IS IN THIS PERIOD OF OPPORTUNITY REALLY FOR HIM BETWEEN THE ELECTION AND THE TRANSITION. I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT THIS IS OBAMA JUST TRYING TO VENT HIS SPLEEN ON THE INCOMING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. I HAVE A FEELING THAT A LOT OF THESE STEPS UPCAN'T TAKE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN. AND OUR ELECTION CAMPAIGNS TAKE A WHOLE YEAR. HE THOUGHT HILLARY WAS GOING TO WIN.  >> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.  >> A LOT OF THIS WAS PLANNED BECAUSE HE COULD DO IT, TAKE THE CREDIT, TAKE THE HEAT. HILLARY WAS NOT GOING TO REVERSE ANY OF IT WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE SO HE COULD GET HIS LEGACY IN PLACE AND SHE WOULD DEFEND IT. NOW HE FINDS HIMSELF FACED WITH DONALD TRUMP BEING HIS SUCCESS AND AND ALL OF HIS PLANS ARE THROW AWRY.  \n",

WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE IN TERMS OF WHAT HE SHOULD DO IN HOW TO HANDLE RURK SHA?  >> YOK I DON'T THINK IT PUTS HI A BAD POSITION. IN BARACK OBAMA THINKS HE CAN BOX THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IN, HE'S SADLY MISTAKEN. PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IS GOING TO MEET NEXT WEEK WITH INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS TO TALK ABOUT THE FACTS ON THE ALLEGATION OF RUSSIAN EFFORTS TO MEDDLE IN THE ELECTION AND HE'LL MAKE UP HIS MIND ACCORDINGLY. THIS IS A GRACELESS WAY FOR OBAMA TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AND VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING HE DID, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION, OR OTHER THINGS HE MAY TRY TO DO INTERNATIONALLY CAN BE REVERSED WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN OR THE ACTION OF CONGRESS.

WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS LATEST PLAY BY PUTIN AND RUSSIA. HAVE THEY OUTMANEUVERED OBAMA AGAIN?  >> I DON'T LIKE TO PRAISE A FORMER KGB COLONEL ON THE MOST POPULAR CABLE CHANNEL IN AMERICA BUT IT WAS A MASTER STROKE. HE PLAYED THE GAME, AS THE AMBASSADOR SAID, VERY SMOOTHLY WITH LAVROV AND THEN WITH TWEETS COMING OUT OF THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY IN LONDON WITH PHOTOGRAPHS OF A DUCKLING AS A LAME DUCK OBAMA AND WE'LL INVITE YOU TO AN ORTHODOX CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION. HE'S SAID TO THE WORLD, PRESIDENT OBAMA YOU ARE COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. AND THE TRUTH IS, HE IS. THIS IS A NEW AGE AFTER NOVEMBER THE 8th. THE IDEA THAT HE PLAYS GOLF FOR EIGHT YEARS AND NOW HE DECIDES TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT RUSSIA, IT'S INCREDIBLE. TRULY INCREDIBLE. WHY NOW AFTER THE INVASION OF THE UKRAINE, THIS IS WHEN HE WAITS TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE OF AN ALLEGED HACK OF THE DNC? HE'S MADE A LAUGHINGSTOCK OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.  >> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP SHOULD DO NOW IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS WHEN HE ASSUMES OFFICE ON THE 20th. BECAUSE STILL SOME DECISIONS WILL HAVE TO BE MADE, SANCTIONS AND FURTHER SANCTIONS AREN'T OFF THE TABLE. THAT IS SOMETHING CERTAINLY THAT HE COULD IMPOSE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT RUSSIA MAKING A FOOL OF THE UNITED STATES OR TRYING TO INTERFERE IN OUR U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  >> CORRECT. ABSOLUTELY. BUT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS. I THINK THE APPROACH PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP HAS TAKEN IS THE CORRECT ONE. LET ME SEE ALL OF THE EVIDENCE AND ONCE I'M ACTUALLY INSTALLED AS THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, I CAN TAKE MEASURES. I'VE READ THE UNCLASSIFIED FBI -- THERE'S A JOINT FBI-DHS REPORT ON THE ATTACK, THE CYBERATTACK CALLED \"GRISLY STEP\". THERE WERE TWO CYBER HACKERS IN SPRING OF 2015 AND SUMMER OF 2016 WENT INTO THE DNC COMPUTER NETWORK. IT'S VERY SPECIFIC. BUT WHAT THEY DID AND WHAT INFORMATION WAS TAKEN OUT IS NOT REVEALED. LET'S WAIT AND SEE. WE'VE GOT 21 DAYS LEFT. THEN THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF MEASURED RESPONSE ONCE THE INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE NEW PRESIDENT.  >> YEAH, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. YOU HAVE TO PUT THE CASE TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THE FACTS, NOT SPECULATION OR HYPERBOLE OR INNUENDO AND MAKE THESE CHOICES BASED ON A FACT PRESIDEATTERN TU FEEL CONFIDENT WITH AND LEAVE THE OPTIONS ON THE TABLE IN TERMS OF HOW YOU WILL IN FACT DEAL WITH IT GOING FORWARD. A LOT OF COMPLEXITY IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS IN TERMS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL POSITION, ALSO, AS YOU KNOW, AS IT RELATES TO ISRAEL, ANOTHER PROBLEMATIC AREA.  >> ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY HE'S DOING THIS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS THINGS IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS AND VI I HAVE TO SAY, I GIVE THE AWARD TO AMBASSADOR BOLTON. THE ANSWER IS CORRECT. THE LEFT THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO WIN. THEY THOUGHT HILLARY WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT. THEY NOW REALIZE THIS THAT THE WHOLE AGENDA, THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS OF CONTINUING TO SOCIALLY ENGINEER AMERICA AND UNDERMINE OUR RELATIONSHIP AROUND THE WORLD, THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN CALLED DONALD TRUMP AND AS A RESULT THEY'VE GOT THREE WEEKS LEFT TO CRAM IT IN, WHETHER IT'S ATTACKING INI ISRAEL OR ANYTHING ELSE. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT. WHAT ELSE CAN WE EXPECT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE NEXT 21 DAYS.  \n",

BUT THERE'S NO SUGGESTION THAT RUSSIA HACKED INTO OUR VOTING SYSTEMS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THEY, IF ANYTHING, WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE, WAS TO TRY TO USE INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED SOMETHING THAT THEY BELIEVE WAS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE, IF THEY SUCCEEDED IN GIVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INFORMATION THAT US WITH ACCURATE, THEN THEY DID WHAT THE MEDIA SHOULD HAVE DONE.  >> JOINING US NOW IS THE LAWMAKER YOU JUST SAID, ARIZONA CONGRESSMAN FRANKS. SOME ACCUSING YOU OF SIDING WITH RUSSIA. YOU TELL US WHAT YOU MEANT.  >> WELL, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY IF YOU COULD SEE THE WHOLE INTERVIEW THAT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT HELPFUL. I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT I MADE IT CLEAR IN THAT INTERVIEW THAT ANYTHING THAT RUSSIA DID TO COMPROMISE ANY OF OUR SYSTEMS SHOULD BE MET WITH THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. I EVEN CALLED MR. PUTIN A KGB THUG IN THE INTERVIEW. SO TO SUGGEST --  >> THEY DIDN'T SHOW THAT IN THE CLIPS. EXACTLY.  >> THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT HAPPENS A LOT. BUT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME HERE. UNFORTUNATELY YOU LEAVE ME WITH LITTLE TO ADD FROM JOHN BOLTON, WHO I CONSIDER TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST FOREIGN POLICY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SECRETARY OF STATE. SEBASTIAN GORKA, I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE COULD SUE ME SUCCESSFULLY FOR PLAGIARISM ANYTIME HE WANTS TO. BUT HAVING SAID THAT, THIS SITUATION IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. THIS PRESIDENT, WHEN HE CAME IN, HAD THE FAMOUS RESET WITH RUSSIA. I THINK HE THOUGHT THE ENTIRE COLD WAR WAS JUST A GIANT MISUNDERSTANDING AND HE STOOD BY AND LET RUSSIA, AS SEBASTIAN GORKA MENTIONED, INVADE UKRAINE EVEN THOUGH WE HAD AN AGREEMENT WITH UKRAINE TO PROTECT THEIR TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY. HE STOOD BY, IN SPITE OF HIS RED LINE IN SYRIA, AND LET THE RUSSIANS BARREL BOMB ALEPPO, KILLING THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN. AND THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN HE FINDS HIS TONGUE AND DOES SOMETHING HE SHOULD HAVE DONE EARLY IN HIS PRESIDENCY AND MADE IT CLEAR WHERE WE STAND AS A COUNTRY THAT WE WILL NOT STAND BY AND LET RUSSIAN EXPANSIONISM TAKE OVER THE WORLD. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS MOCKED UP THE WORLD WITH BARACK OBAMA. IT TURNS OUT HE'S NOT QUITE FINISHED, IT SEEMS.  >> YOU SEAR S'RE SAYING THE MAI MEDIA SHOULD HAVE DONE THEIR JOB, PROPERLY COVERED THE ELECTION, PROPERLY COVERED THE TORIS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, HER E-MAILS, HER DELETING E-MAILS, ABOUT HER SERVER. ALL OF THE ABOVE. THAT IS CERTAINLY TRUE. AND AS IT RELATES TO PRESIDENT OBAMA, I THINK WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE OF HIS FAILED POLICY. THERE IS NO RESPECT THERE BETWEEN VLADIMIR PUTIN AND BARACK OBAMA. AND NOW WE FIND THREE WEEKS BEFORE WE HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT IN OFFICE THIS ATTEMPT TO CERTAINLY TRY TO BOX PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IN. BUT IT SEEMS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN DID NOT FALL FOR THE BAIT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WISHED HE DID.  >> WELL, AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD SAY THAT BETTER THAN YOU JUST SAID. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS WEAKENED AMERICA ACROSS THE EIGHT YEARS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXISTENCE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DECADES TRYING TO CLEAN UP THE MESS. I HOPE THAT MR. TRUMP IS UP TO IT. I BELIEVE HE IS. I BELIEVE WE HAV DAY IN AMERICA AND I JUST HOPE SO DESPERATELY THAT WE RETURN TO SOME OF THE GREAT FOUNDATIONS THAT MADE OUR COUNTRY THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY.

HOW DO YOU REACT TO THAT?  >> HE IS ALSO SAID THE OPPOSITE. HE BROUGHT UP THE CONVERSATION AND THE NEED FOR REFORM HAS TO BE DISCUSSED. HE, IN FACT, ENDORSED THE FREEDOM ACT, WHICH WAS PASSED IN 2015, WHICH, ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZED IT AS BEING TOO MODERATE, IT WAS VOTED ON BY 200 REPUBLICANS, MORE OR LESS, AND THE HOUSE. 35 REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE.  >> I THINK MOST AMERICANS WANT MORE SECURITY. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY DON'T WANT INDIVIDUALS LIKE SNOWDEN TO GO OUT WITH NATIONAL SECURITY, THAT COULD CAUSE PEOPLE'S LIVES. WE HAVE SEEN THAT ON A NUMBER OF LEVELS.

CLINTON, HER POLITICAL JUDGMENT, AND THE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR WORKINGS OF HER ORGANIZATION. NOW SHE WAS ON THE FENCE. THEN THE BOMBSHELL. FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20TH, THE FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY ANNOUNCED THE BOROUGH WAS REOPENING THE INVESTIGATION INTO MRS. CLINTON'S EMAILS. BECAUSE OF THOSE EMAILS OF COURAGE OF OUR PERTINENT INVESTIGATION. I AGREED WE SHOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN AND REVIEW THEM. LESS THAN TWO WEEKS LATER, STILL DOWN IN THE POLLS AND COUNTED OUT BY MOST POLITICAL OBSERVERS, DONALD JAY TRUMP ONE WORKING CLASS BOAT BY HUGE MARGINS. BECOMING OUR PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE MOST STUNNING STORY IN A LONG TIME. BACK WITH US NOW. YOU WATCH THIS SO CLOSELY, EVERY SINGLE DAY, CHRIS STIREWALT, AND THEN WE LOOK AT SO MANY WHO GOT IT SO WRONG. DONALD TRUMP MADE IT THROUGH ALL THOSE CONTROVERS UNBELIEVABLE WK BACK AT IT.  >> HE LEARNED. HE LEARNED SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT, AND IT DIDN'T CLICK FOR HIM UNTIL THE END. THE WAY THAT HE RUN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION WAS BY RECORDING CONTROVERSY AND KICKING HIS WAY THROUGH FIRESTORM AFTER FIRESTORM. NEVER APOLOGIZE, NEVER BACKED DOWN. YES, JOHN McCAIN, I AM NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE TO JOHN McCAIN. WE WILL JUST FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT. IT WORKED. IT KEPT THE ATTENTION ON HIM. THOSE DIFFER IN IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION. THE FIGHT THAT HE GAVE WITH THE FAMILY. THE FIGHT THAT HE HAD WITH A LEASE OF A CHILD WHO WAS UNIVERSE THAT HE WAS INVOLVED. IT DIDN'T WORK. IT HURT HIM, BUT THEN HE FIGURED IT OUT. MAKE YOURSELF LIKE A HOLE IN THE WATER, MAN. LAY DOWN. YOU BE QUIET, GIVE TELEPROMPTER SPEECHES, ACT IN A MORE RESTRAINED WAY, HE DID NO PRESS CONFERENCES. HE HAD NO CONTROVERSIES FOR THE FINAL THREE WEEKS OF THE ELECTION, AND HE JUST WATCHED HILLARY CLINTON TWIST AND THE WIND AROUND THE FBI STUFF AND HAVE THAT ATTENTION. WITH A CANE THE NEGATIVE FOOTAGE.  >> YOU HAVE TO REMIND EVERYBODY HE IS NOT A POLITICIAN. HE IS A NEW YORK BUSINESSMAN. HOW DID HE KNOW THAT? 'S BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO WORDS, KELLYANNE CONWAY. NO MATTER TO HIDE OF THE AISLE YOU ARE IN, KELLYANNE CONWAY IS ONE OF THE BEST OPERATIVES, I WOULD ARGUE. SHE TOPS THE LIST. AND HOW TO WIN AN ELECTION. THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID THAT THE CLEANSING CAMPAIGNS WOULD'VE DROPPED THE BALL HERE. WE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS, I DO BELIEVE THEY MISHANDLED THE EMAIL, BUT I AM BEYOND MISHANDLING THE EMAIL, WHICH I THINK IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS SORT OF PROVED A LOT OF AMERICANS THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT NOT BE TRUSTWORTHY, MAYBE WE ARE NOT TRUSTWORTHY. WE SHOULD NOT VOTE FOR HER. SHE HAD A PROBLEM COMMUNICATING WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I THINK THEY DEPENDED ON JUST TALKING, WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER OUR DEMOCRATIC BASIS. YOU NEVER VISITED THE STATE OF WISCONSIN ONCE. THEIR CAMPAIGN WAS OVERCONFIDENT, AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHETHER YOU LIKE BARACK OBAMA OR NOT. BOTH AND 202008 AND 2012, HE REALLY HONED AND ABOUT HAVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  \n",

      "SHOW AND YOU. AND I HOPE OUR HUMAN CONNECTION CONTINUES. I'LL BE AT OVER A DIFFERENT LINE. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. WITH LOVE.  >> AND HAPPY NEW YEAR, HAPPY 2017 AND WELCOME TO \"HANNITY.\" TONIGHT, WE HAVE A SHORT OPENING MONOLOGUE. DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CLAIM OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IS DIRECTLY TIED TO THE 2016 ELECTION HACKING AND WITH WEEKS TO GO BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE, PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA. THEY RELEASED A COINCIDING REPORT SUPPOSEDLY CONTAINING EVIDENCE THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT COORDINATED ALL OF THESE CYBER ATTACKS. THAT REPORT GETS VERY FEW DETAILS AND A MASSIVE BIG DISCLAIMER. THE KRATZ WERE ALSO POINTING A FINGER AT WIKILEAKS, SAYING THAT THEY PROVIDED THEM THOUSANDS OF EMAILS FROM THE DNC AND JOHN PODESTA. EXPOSING CORRUPTION, MEDIA COLLUSION WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND DOWNRIGHT DIRTY POLITICS ALL THE WAY AROUND. IN LIGHT OF ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS, I DECIDED TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCE. SO YESTERDAY, I TRAVELED TO LONDON TO SIT DOWN WITH WIKILEAKS FOUNDER, JULIAN ASSANGE, IN AN ATTEMPT TO SET THE RECORD STREET. FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS, HE HAS BEEN CONFINED AT THE ECUADORIAN EMBASSY WHERE HE HAS NOT SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY IN ALL THAT TIME. SO JULIAN ASSANGE OF COURSE FOUNDED THE GROUP WIKILEAKS IN 2006, HE MADE INTERNATIONAL HEADLINES AFTER RELEASING THOUSANDS OF U.S. CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS. HE WAS DETAINED IN ENGLAND AFTER SWEDISH OFFICIALS ISSUED AN ARREST WARRANT THAT HE MAY HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED TWO WOMEN. A CHARGE THAT HE WILL RESPOND TO LATER IN THIS INTERVIEW. HE WAS GRANTED ASYLUM IN THE ECUADORIAN EMBASSY IN THE CITY OF LONDON. HE HAS BEEN LIVING THERE EVER SENSE, AND VERY, VERY CONFINED TINY QUARTERS. IN THIS WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW WHICH WE WILL SHOW FOR THE ENTIRE HOUR TONIGHT, HE WILL EXPOSE GOVERNMENT AND MEDIA CORRUPTION.  >> Sean: LET ME START WITH THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, HOW BIG A ROLE DO YOU FEEL WIKILEAKS HAD IN THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION? YOU DIDN'T THINK DONALD TRUMP WAS GOING TO WIN.  >> I THOUGHT THE ESTABLISHMENT FOR ONE OF THE BETTER WORDS, WOULD SEE HILLARY CLINTON AND WOULD PILE IN MORE MONEY AND MORE ENERGY. TV NETWORKS ON HER SIDE. I THINK IT ADMITS SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL. WHICH IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS FOR A CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THE PORTION TO THE DEGREE THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT THOUGHT SHE WOULD LOSE. AND SHE WAS AGGRESSIVELY PROJECTING THAT SHE WOULD BE THE INEVITABLE WINNER. SHE WAS ABOUT FIVE -- TEN POINT POINTS, IF THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO LOSE, MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN DIFFERENT RESULTS.  >> Sean: IT'S A VERY INTERESTING POST ELECTION. DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY. BUT THE NARRATIVE HAS BEGUN THAT IN FACT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS ACCUSING WIKILEAKS AND HAVING RECEIVED MATERIALS FROM RUSSIA AND RUSSIAN CYBER CRIMINALS WITH THE POLITICAL AGENDA. THEY'RE NOT JUST A TALKING ABOUT THE JOHN PODESTA EMAILS, BUT IN OTHER WAYS. I'VE ASKED YOU BEFORE. DIDN'T RUSH I GIVE YOU THIS INFORMATION OR ANYBODY ASSOCIATED WITH RUSSIA?  \n",

      ">> THEY ARE NOT A STATE PARTY. THE ANSWER IS NO. BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE MOST RECENT, WE HAD FIVE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, CIA DATA, PRESENTING THEIR ACCUSATIONS TO UNDERPIN OBAMA'S PUTTING OUT 35 RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS. WHAT WAS MISSING FROM ALL OF THOSE? IT'S VERY STRANGE. MY INTERPRETATION IS NOT SURPRISINGLY, A PROBLEM THEY FEEL, WE DON'T KNOW HOW WIKILEAKS GOT THIS INFORMATION. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN. LET'S IMAGINE, OKAY, THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WIKILEAKS PUBLISHED INFORMATION. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? WIKILEAKS PUBLISHED TRUE INFORMATION THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC READ, THAT INFORMATION WAS THE WORDS OF HILLARY CLINTO HILLARY CLINTON. HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, JOHN PODESTA AND OTHER PEOPLE IN HER CAMPAIGN. AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC READ THAT INFORMATION. TRUE INFORMATION. AND IT SAID, WE DON'T LIKE THESE PEOPLE. AND THEN VOTED ACCORDINGLY. WHAT THEY WANT TO DO INSTEAD IS CONFLATE OUR PUBLICATION OF TRUE INFORMATION WITH, SAY, HACKING OR ALLEGED HACKING. FROM VOTE COUNTING MACHINES. EVEN OBAMA ADMITTED THERE HAS BEEN NO HACKING FROM THAT. FOR MOST AMERICANS -- -- GO SPK DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, IN FACT, WIKILEAKS WAS WORKING WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION.  >> Sean: IS THAT TRUE IN ANY SHAPE MATTER OR FORM?  >> NO. IF YOU READ THE STATEMENTS CAREFULLY, IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT. THEY KIND OF MENTION ONE FACT HERE, ONE FACT THEY THERE, AND NOTHING ELSE. IN THE MOST UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION FROM THE DECEMBER 29TH STATEMENT, WHAT IS COMPLETELY ABSENT FROM ALL THOSE STATEMENTS IS WIKILEAKS. TOTALLY ABSENT. WHAT IS GOING ON? I BELIEVE TWO THINGS ARE GOING ON. NUMBER ONE, THEY DON'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE THAT WIKILEAKS IS INVOLVED IN THAT WAY. WHY MY CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT? BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ONE PERSON IN THE WORLD AND I THINK IT IS ACTUALLY ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON. WITHOUT PUBLICATIONS. AND THAT IS ME.  >> Sean: CAN BE SAVED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT YOU DID NOT GET THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THE DNC, JOHN PODESTA, THAT YOU DID NOT GET IT FROM RUSSIA OR ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH RUSSIA?  >> OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS, OUR SOURCE IS NOT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. IT IS NOT STATE PARTIES.  >> Sean: THERE WAS ONE REPORT THAT SOMEONE YOU ARE FRIENDLY WITH WAS HANDED THE DOCUMENTS AT A AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN FROM A DISGRUNTLED DEMOCRAT. BECAUSE OF REVELATION SHOWED THAT BERNIE SANDERS HAD BEEN BETRAYED AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE CORRUPTION OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. CAN YOU CONFIRM OR DENY THAT?  \n",

AND SO, I CAN'T COMMENT ON OTHER PEOPLE'S STATEMENTS ABOUT OUR SOURCES EXCEPT THAT THEY -- WHAT WE HAVE SET. SAID. WHICH IS THAT OUR SOURCES ARE NOT STATE PARTIES.  >> Sean: HAVE YOU EVER TALKED TO VLADIMIR PUTIN?  >> NO.  >> Sean: HAVE YOU EVER TALK TO ANY OF HIS SURROGATES? DONALD TRUMP? ANY OF HIS SURROGATES?  >> NO. NO. NO. I THINK WHERE THIS CLAIM IS COMING FROM IS THERE IS A RADIO GUY ON WC AI WHICH IS A MUTUAL FRIEND WHO WANTED TO COME SEE ME, TO SEE IF -- HE DIDN'T COME TO LONDON, BUT HE DIDN'T LEAVE WITH ME.  >> Sean: IF YOU SAY IT IS FALSE, IT DID NOT COME FROM RUSSIA, AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS ADVANCING THE NARRATIVE. IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?  >> WELL, HE IS ACTING LIKE A LAWYER. HE DOESN'T SAY THAT. HE DOESN'T SAY WIKILEAKS OBTAINED ITS INFORMATION FROM RUSSIA, WORKED WITH RUSSIA --  >> Sean: HE IS TRYING TO SAY RUSSIA IS TRYING TO INFLUENCE AMERICAN ELECTIONS.  >> IT YES. DOES SAY -- HE DOESN'T SAY RUSSIA WAS TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION FOR DONALD TRUMP. HE DOESN'T SAY THAT. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE LANGUAGE THAT IS USED TO TRY TO CONFLATE THINGS TOGETHER. THE QUESTION IS, WIKILEAKS PUBLICATIONS. TRUE INFORMATION THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TOOK UP AND THEY ACTED ACCORDINGLY. DID YOU HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE? STATISTICALLY, YES. IT WAS THE NUMBER ONE TOPIC ON FACEBOOK THROUGHOUT OCTOBER. THE NUMBER ONE TOPIC ON TWITTER. ALSO THROUGHOUT OCTOBER. DID IT CHANGE THE OUTCOME? WHO KNOWS. IF IT DID, THE ACCUSATION IS STATEMENT OF HILLARY CLINTON AS HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, JOHN PODESTA AND THE DNC -- THEY ARE TRUE STATEMENTS IS WHAT CHANGED THE ELECTION.  >> Sean: HOW DO YOU VIEW YOURSELF? ARE YOU A JOURNALIST? DO YOU VIEW THIS AS REPORTING -- FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AT ONE POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" GOT A HOLD OF DONALD TRUMP'S TAXES WHICH BY THE WAY THEY OBTAINED A WOW ILLEGALLY. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO REVEAL YOUR SOURCE BUT NO ONE HAS SAID WHAT YOU RELEASED IS NOT TRUE. THEY WENT FORWARD WITH THE STORY ON HIS TAXES. IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE?  >> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. OUR MATERIAL, THE PUBLIC RESPONDED TO IT MORE THAN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\" BUT THE EDITOR OF \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" SHE HAS COME OUT AND SAID THAT HE WOULD DO THE SAME THING WITH WIKILEAK WIKILEAKS. IF THEY HAD OBTAINED THE INFORMATION, THEY WOULD PUBLISH IT. UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE. I BELIEVE THEY WOULD SELECTIVELY MAY BE PUBLISHED, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE WHAT WE DID WHICH WAS PRESENT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC EVERYTHING THAT WE KNEW. CAN YOU JUST IMAGINE IF WIKILEAKS HAD INFORMATION WRECKING THE PRIMARY? AND WE WITHHELD THAT INFORMATION UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION? UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE SORTS OF ACTS DO HAPPEN.

IF THEY DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT CHINA AND THEY SELECTIVELY CHOOSE THIS, IS IT TO DELEGITIMIZE DONALD TRUMP? WHAT IS YOUR INTERPRETATION ON THAT?  >> IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE ALLEGATIONS ARE, THEY DON'T MENTION WIKILEAKS. THE ONLY MENTION OUR PUBLICATIO PUBLICATION. OUR PUBLICATION HAD WIDE UPTAKE BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY ARE ALL TRUE. BUT THAT'S NOT THE ALLEGATION THAT IS BEING PRESENTED. BY THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE. SO WHY SUCH A DRAMATIC RESPONSE? WELL, THE REASON IS OBVIOUS. THEY ARE TRYING TO DELEGITIMIZE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AS IT GOES INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO SAY THAT PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IS NOT A LEGITIMATE --  >> Sean: IS YOUR INFORMATION --  >> THEY WILL HARP ON IT FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. I THINK THAT IS A MISTAKE. I THINK THAT IS A MISTAKE NOT JUST IN FACT, THAT IS A MISTAKE FOR THE U.S. DEMOCRATIC PARTY. I THINK IT IS A STUPID MANEUVER. IT IS THE SAME REASON WHY THEY LOST THE ELECTION. WHICH IS INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON SUBSTANCE, THEY FOCUSED ON OTHER THINGS WHICH THEY THINK HIS SHORT-TERM WINS. BUT IT'S NOT STRATEGIC. A LITTLE COMMENT LIKE HERE AND THERE FROM TRUMP. HOW OUTRAGEOUS IT IS THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC RECEIVED TRUE INFORMATION BEFORE THE ELECTION. THEY WANT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE.  >> Sean: IF THE INFORMATION YOU HAD WAS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN, WOULD YOU HAVE RELEASED THAT?  >> ABSOLUTELY. ONCE AGAIN, THINK ABOUT IT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE WON A LOT OF MEDIA AWARDS. WE HAVE BUT TRUSTED OUR READERS.

THEY DIDN'T PUBLISH IT. NO ONE HAS COME OUT AND IT SENT THAT. THEY DID, THEY WOULD HURT OUR REPUTATION OR TRUST FROM OUR SOURCES.  >> Sean: I KNOW YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR SOURCES AND WHEN YOU FIRST TOLD ME ON MY RADIO SHOW THAT IT WAS NOT RUSSIA, YOU SAID SO RELUCTANTLY, CAN I TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER? WAS THE SOURCE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES?  >> I DON'T WANT TO CONSTRAIN WHETHER IT WAS SOMEONE INSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE DNC, AND THE SERVICE PROVIDERS, THE PROVIDES THE OR OUTSIDE, I THINK WE HAVE ALREADY POSTED QUITE A LOT.  >> Sean: MORE THAN YOU WOULD LIKE.  >> MORE THAN WE WOULD LIKE. THAT WAS NECESSARY TO DO BECAUSE THERE WAS A SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT FROM THE CONTENTS OF OUR PUBLICATION WITH ITS RUSSIAN NARRATIVE. OUR SOURCES ARE INTERESTED IN TWO THINGS. THEY'RE INTERESTED IN PROTECTING THEIR IDENTITY BUT ALSO NOT GOING THROUGH ALL THAT EFFORT AND RISKING THEMSELVES ONLY TO HAVE THE PUBLICATION UNDERMINED.  \n",

NOTHING. WHAT THEY HAVE IS WHAT THEY CALL INDICATORS. A WAY TO RECOGNIZE THESE ALLEGED RUSSIAN TOOLS HAVE BEEN USED ON THIS. IN RESPONSE TO THAT, SOME ENGINEER FOUND HIS SIGNATURE ON ONE OF THEIR LAPTOPS. OKAY. THEN THIS WAS -- I'VE READ THOSE REPORTS IN DETAIL. IT WAS DISCOVERED THIS WAS A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TOOL.

DO YOU BUY THAT?  >> YES, THAT IS THE UNSTATED PREMISE. GOOD FOR YOU, MEGYN. THAT'S THE NOTION THAT THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO PUSH. AND YOU CAN HEAR THAT IN A MONTH OR TWO OR THREE MONTHS BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS GOT HIM IN THERE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, STEP BACK. WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY VOTES HAVE CHANGED BECAUSE OF ANY RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE. I BELIEVE -- --  >> Megyn: SO YOU DON'T BELIEVE JULIAN A A WHEN HE SAYS THAT TE RUSSIANS DIDN'T HACK?  >> IT COULD'VE BEEN SOMEONE THAT SAID I'M NOT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. HOW DOES HE KNOW? BACK TO THE LARGER QUESTION, WHY ALL THIS FUSS? BECAUSE I THINK THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO SUGGEST THIS ELECTION WAS SOMEHOW ILLEGITIMATE BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS WANTED TRUMP TO WI WIN. WHY WOULD THE RUSSIANS WANT TRUMP TO WIN? HE HAS PROMISED ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, BOTH VERY BAD THANKS FOR THE RUSSIANS. SECOND POINT. ONE HAVE THE RUSSIANS THRIVED IN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS, HAVE THEY GOT WEAKER OR STRONGER? OBAMA AND CLINTON HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD FOR RUSSIAN POWER. TRUMP WILL NOT BE GOOD FOR RUSSIAN POWER. I THINK THE BASIC PREMISE UNDERCUTS THE NOTION HERE THAT THE LIBERALS --  >> Megyn: IN THE DEMOCRATS DEFENSE, IF THE RUSSIANS DID INFLUENCE THE ELECTION, LET'S IT WASN'T TO HELP DONALD TRUMP. THAT IS A HUGE DEAL. WE DO NEED TO KNOW WHO DID IT. THERE DO NEED TO BE CONSEQUENCES TO IT. AND CAN WE HAVE OUR PRESIDENT REJECTING 17 INTEL AGENCIES? YOU WANT TO GET ALONG WITH PUTIN, BUT HE DID SOMETHING BAD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH.  >> RIGHT, I DON'T THINK HE'S REJECTED IT. HE HASN'T REJECTED OUTRIGHT. HE'S RAISE QUESTIONS. IT COULD BE RUSSIAN, CHINESE, A GUY LYING IN BED.  >> Megyn: SHE CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE HE IS A BELIEVER.  >> I KNOW, BUT WE WILL FIND OUT IN A DAY OR TWO AGO. THEY HAVE SOME SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. I HAD BRIEFINGS FROM THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, SOME OF THEM WERE RIGHT, SOME WERE NOT. THERE WERE SOME WHO POLITICAL APPOINTEES. ALL THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO DELIVER WHAT IT IS THEY HAD, AND THEY CANCELED THE HEARING? THEY WEREN'T READY YET. IN 48 HOURS, WE MAY GET SOME FINAL TRUTHS. SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT, JUDGE BRANDEIS SAID.  >> Megyn: CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW AWKWARD THAT WOULD BE? IF THEY LOOK OVER EACH OTHER LIKE ALL THE INTEL BRIEF THERE IS HER DISLIKE OF. THANK YOU, BILL. BREAKING TONIGHT, FOR PEOPLE ARE UNDER A LITTLE REST AFTER A TRULY UGLY VIDEO SERVICES UNDER CHICAGO. A YOUNG MAN TIED UP, HIS MOUTH TAPED SHUT. HE IS KICKED, BEATEN, AND THREATENED BY A KNIFE BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE SHOUTING [BLEEP] TRUMP, [BLEEP] WHITE PEOPLE. WHAT'S WORSE IS THE PLEASE SAVE THE MAN BEING BEATEN IS MENTALLY DISABLED. WE ARE GATHERING MORE INFORMATION RIGHT NOW, THE POLICE HAVE JUST SPOKEN OUT ABOUT THIS PUBLICLY. WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT THEY SAID SHORTLY. PLUS, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND LEADERS ARE IN A NEW WAR ON OBAMACARE. IT WAS VERY INTERESTING DAY ON CAPITOL HILL. THIS ONE AFFECTS MILLIONS OF PATIENTS. MILLIONS OF TAXPAYERS. UP NEXT ON WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. BEING DISCUSSED FOR THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, THE PEOPLE. JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO IS UP NEXT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY.  \n",

      "GOOD EVENING, LIFE FROM AMERICA'S HEADQUARTERS. FOUR PEOPLE ARE IN CUSTODY FOLLOWING A DISTURBING VIDEO POSTED TO FACEBOOK LIFE THAT SHOWED A YOUNG MAN BEING HOSTAGE AND TORTURED IN CHICAGO. YOU CAN HEAR DEROGATORY REMARKS BEING MADE AGAINST PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP AND WHITE PEOPLE. THE VICTIM WAS ALSO REPEATEDLY KICKED AND HIT, ALL WHILE BEING TIED UP WITH HIS MOUTH TAPED SHUT. THE YOUNG MAN IS NOW BEING TREATED AT A HOSPITAL FOR HIS INJURIES. THOUSANDS OF MACY'S WORKERS, MAY BE LET GO. MACY'S SAYS IT FOLLOWS -- I'M JACKIE, NOW, BACK TO HANNITY.  >> Sean: >> WE PUBLISHED EMAILST SHOWS PODESTA RESPONDING TO A PHISHING EMAIL. NOW, HOW DID THEY RESPOND? PODESTA GAVE OUT HIS PASSWORD, WHICH WAS THE WORD PASSWORD. HIS OWN STAFF SAID THIS EMAIL THAT YOU RECEIVED? THIS IS TOTALLY LEGITIMATE. THIS IS SOMETHING A 14-YEAR-OLD KID COULD HAVE HACKED.  >> Sean: SAD WE DON'T HAVE CYBER SECURITY. THAT WAS JULIAN ASSANGE, TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF SECURITY THAT WAS WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP TWEETED OUT... HE ALSO SAID RUSSIANS DID NOT GIVE HIM THE INFORMATION. WE CONTINUE WITH FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, NEWT GINGRICH, YOU TOLD ME YOU WATCHED THE INTERVIEW. I WISH I THE TIME TO AIR MORE, WE HAVE AT LEAST 40 MINUTES MORE. WHAT WERE YOUR GENERAL THOUGHTS? BECAUSE WHEN WE ASKED THE AUDIENCE WHAT THEY THOUGHT, WHETHER THEY BELIEVED ASSANGE OR OBAMA AND HILLARY, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY BELIEVED ASSANGE. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?  >> LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL, I THINK WHAT YOU DID IS SO FASCINATING AND ASSANGE IS SUCH A DOWN TO EARTH STRAIGHTFORWARD INTERVIEWEE INTERVIEWEE. WE DON'T HAVE CYBERSECURITY FOR MUCH OF WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE ARE WAY BEHIND THE CURVE IN WHAT WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DO IF WE ARE GOING TO FUNCTION AS A SOCIETY. IN THAT SENSE, VERY REVEALING INTERVIEW. SECOND, THE IDEA THAT A 14-YEAR-OLD COULD HAVE DONE IT BUT IT WAS THE RUSSIANS? IT TELLS YOU HOW DESPERATE OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE TO FIND SOME EXCUSE TO DISCREDIT DONALD J. TRUMP BECAUSE THEY I T STAND THE IDEA THAT HE WON BACK BECAUSE HILLARY WAS SO BAD, BECAUSE THE OBAMA RECORD WAS SO BAD, BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE TIRED OF RADICAL POLICIES. IN SOME WAYS, THEY'VE TRUMPED THIS WHOLE THING UP. IN ORDER TO TRY TO DISCREDIT THE PRESIDENT-ELECT.  >> Sean: AND THAT IS THE AMAZING THING HERE. WHETHER YOU LIKE IT JULIAN ASSANGE OR NOT, HE'S REALLY COMMITTED HIS LIFE TO THIS WORK. UNEQUIVOCALLY, HE'S NEVER SPOKEN TO PUTIN, HIS SURROGATES, TRUMP, OR HIS SURROGATES. WHAT IF THE INFORMATION WAS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, WOULD YOU HAVE RELEASED IT? I ASKED HIM. HIS ANSWER WAS ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY YES. IF YOU LOOK LOOK AT WHAT WE LED ABOUT THE COLLUSION WITH THE NEWS MEDIA AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS MORE TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION THAN ANYTHING WE'RE GETTING FROM \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" OR POLITICAL OR NBC OR CBS OR ABC. IS THAT A STRETCH TO SAY?  \n",

THANKS FOR WATCHING US TONIGHT. PUTIN, TRUMP, AND THE ELECTION. THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS EVENINGS \"TALKING POINTS\" MEMO. TODAY IN WASHINGTON, THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE HELD HEARINGS ABOUT RUSSIA ALLEGEDLY SUBVERTING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. FRONT AND CENTER WAS DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, JAMES CLAPPER.  >> RUSSIANS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF INTERFERING IN ELECTIONS. THERE IS AN OTHER PEOPLE'S. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED A MORE AGGRESSIVE OR DIRECT CAMPAIGN TO INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTION PROCESS. THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS CASE.  >> Bill: OF COURSE, IT IS ALL THE HACKING INTO THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE. SOME OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS. \"TALKING POINTS\" BELIEVES MR. CLAPPER, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT HIM. THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT THE MAN. NOW, IT HAS BEEN NO DEFINITIVE PROOF THAT THE RUSSIAN LEADER, VLADIMIR PUTIN DID TRY TO INTERFERE WITH OUR VOTES.  >> WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS AND WE PUT PEOPLE'S LIVES AT RISK TO GLEAN SUCH INFORMATION. AND SO, IF WE WERE TO EXPOSE IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY PERSUASIVE TO EVERYONE, THEN, WE COULD KISS THAT OFF. BECAUSE WE WILL LOSE IT.  >> Bill: MR. CLAPPER SAYING HE CANNOT EXPOSES SOURCES OVER EXPLAIN EXPLAIN HOW HE GOT THE USA, HOW THE USA GOT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RUSSIAN HACKING. SO, THIS BECOMES A VERY COMPLICATED MATTER BECAUSE SOME DEMOCRATS ARE CHARGING THAT THE HACK OF DEMOCRATIC STALWARTS LIKE JOHN PODESTA INFLUENCED THE VOTING. REPUBLICANS SAY, NONSENSE, THE EXPOSED EMAIL SIMPLY POINTED OUT POLITICAL INTRIGUE AND DEPRESSED CORRUPTION. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IF ANY OF US WERE INFLUENCED BY PODESTA'S RANTINGS, BUT IT SEEMS FAR-FETCHED TO ME. DESPITE THE INTEL CONSENSUS FROM A PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IS NOT ACCEPTING OF THE VERDICT AGAINST PUTIN. NOW, MR. TRUMP WILL BE BRIEFED TOMORROW BY INTELLIGENCE LEADERS. MAYBE THAT WILL CHANGE. BUT FOR YOU AND ME COME AMERICANS WHO SINCERELY WATCH THEIR ALEXIS AND JUSTICE, THE HG SHOULD BE A SERIOUS MATTER. AGAIN, \"TALKING POINTS\" BELIEVES THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE INVOLVEDS MUCH CHAOS AS POSSIBLE FOR AMERICA. AND NOTHING HAPPENS IN RUSSIA AT THAT LEVEL UNLESS PUTIN APPROVES. BUT PUTIN IS NOT HOLDING A SMOKING GUN BECAUSE U.S. INTELLIGENT HAS TO PROTECT ITS ORIFICES AND INFORMATION. COMING UP, THE RUSSIANS DID IT. PUTIN KNEW ABOUT IT. AND PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP HAS TO DECIDE FURTHER ACTION AGAINST RUSSIA IF IT IS NECESSARY. THAT IS THE \"MEMO.\" JOINING US FROM WASHINGTON, A CYBERSECURITY ANALYSIS.

SOME PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE THAT PUTIN AT THE RUSSIANS DID IT, YOU HEARD ASSANGE TELL SEAN HANNITY THIS WEEK THAT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. AND THERE WERE SOME IN CONGRESS WHO DON'T BELIEVE IT. THAT IS WHAT MUDDIES THE WATERS. I BELIEVE IT, YOU BELIEVE IT, I THINK YOU BELIEVE IT, CORRECT?  >> THE WORLD IS NOT FLAT.  >> Bill: I GOT IT. WHEN YOU HAVE SO MUCH CONFUSION, IT IS VERY HARD TO GET A CONSENSUS OR TO GET PEOPLE MOBILIZED. WHAT DO YOU SAY?  >> IF YOU KNOW, BILL THIS IS AN ONGOING DISCUSSION WE HAVE BEEN HAVING FOR A LONG TIME.

NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IT INFLUENCED THE ELECTION, I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THAT. I AM INTERESTED IN TWO QUESTIONS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO RESPOND, TWO, WITH THE PRESIDENT-ELECT FINALLY WISE UP AND REALIZE THAT IN FACT, PUTIN IS NOT OUR FRIEND, HE IS OUR ENEMY, HE IS BENT UPON DOING AS MUCH DAMAGE AS POSSIBLE?  >> Bill: WHAT TRUMP WANTS TO DO IS NEUTRALIZE PUTIN AS AN ENTITY.

SPEAK TO EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING FROM THE PRESIDENT, HILLARY CLINTON, THE CAMPAIGN, DETERMINING THE OUTCOME OF THE N IS NOT TRUE. HERE IS WHAT IS TRUE. DID THEY HACK INTO THE VOTING MACHINES? NO THEY DID NOT. DID WIKILEAKS REVEAL HOW CORRUPT THE LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA IS? YES, IT DID. RACIST, HOMOPHOBIC, SEXIST COMMENTS? YEAH, THAT WAS REVEALED. THE DNC TRIED TO DISCREDIT BERNIE SANDERS AND RIG THE PRIMARY FOR HILLARY CLINTON? YEAH, THAT WAS REVEALED TOO. THIS ISN'T ABOUT JULIAN ASSANGE, THIS IS ANOTHER EXCUSE BY THE DEMOCRATS AS TO WHY HILLARY CLINTON LOST THE ELECTION IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE LEGITIMIZED -- DELEGITIMIZE DONALD TRUMP AND HIS VICTORY. WHEN JULIAN ASSANGE WAS 16 YEARS OLD, HE HACKED INTO NASA. WE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT WIKI LINKS FOR TEN YEARS.

WE CAN'T HAVE RUSSIA, NORTH KOREA, CHINA, IRAN, HACKING INTO OUR GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS. SO WHAT IS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DONE IN THE PAST EIGHT YEARS TO STOP THIS? LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. MOST OF YOU DO NOT KNOW THIS, IT'S NOT BEING REPORTED BY THE MEDIA BUT LET'S LOOK AT THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN HACKED INTO SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK OFFICE. SINCE 2009, LOOK AT THIS. HACKERS HAVE ATTACKED THE U.S. ELECTRICAL GRID. THEY'VE ATTACKED THE PENTAGON, FIGHTER PROJECTS. NASA, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, THE FEDERAL CONNECTION NETWORKS, EVEN THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE. THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION. LOOK AT THIS. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN HACKED SINCE OBAMA HAS BEEN PRESIDENT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN HACKED. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS BEEN HACKED. AND AT THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, HAVE BEEN HACKED. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND JOHN McCAIN AND THE DEMOCRATS AND LINDSEY GRAHAM, IF THEY WERE ALL SERIOUS ABOUT HACKING, WOULD THEY HAVE NOT DONE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS WHILE ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING? DID YOU EVEN HEAR ABOUT THIS BEFORE? LET'S TAKE FOR EXAMPLE, CHINA. THEY HACKED THE OFFICE OF PERSONAL MANAGEMENT. THEY GOT SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON OVER 21 MILLION PEOPLE IN AMERICA AND THAT INFORMATION MEANS THOSE PEOPLE'S INFORMATION WAS COMPROMISED. AND THEN THE CIA AT THE TIME, IT WAS SO SERIOUS THAT THEY REMOVED AGENCY OFFICERS THAT WERE STATIONED IN CHINA AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. BUT THE PRESIDENT NEVER SPOKE ABOUT IT PUBLICLY. NOT ONE TIME. NO DIPLOMATS WERE REMOVED, SANCTIONS. EDWARD SNOWDEN WAS LEAKING ALL KINDS OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. LOOK AT ALL THE SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT WAS EXPOSED BY WIKILEAKS IN YEARS PRIOR. I HAVE DEMOCRATS, JOHN McCAIN, LINDSEY GRAHAM, IN ALL THIS TIME, HAVE THEY DONE ANYTHING? HAVE THEY DONE ANYTHING TO STOP STUFF LIKE THIS THAT WE PUT ON THE SCREEN FROM HAPPENING? NO, THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING. SO LET ME PUT THIS ALL INTO PERSPECTIVE. THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POLITICAL PARTY BEING HACKED AND SENSITIVE U.S. GOVERNMENT INFORMATION THAT IS BEING STOLEN, THAT EXPOSES SECRETS, AND POTENTIALLY IS PUTTING AMERICAN LIVES AT RISK. THE ONLY THING THE DNC AND THE PODESTA LEAKS EXPOSED WAS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS BEING CORRUPT. IT CONFIRMED EVERYTHING THAT MANY OF US ALREADY SUSPECTED. SO HERE IS MY MESSAGE TO THE SORE LOSER LEFT. YOU CAN COMPLAIN ALL YOU WANT ABOUT THIS BUT THE FACT IS, THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR EIGHT YEARS AND EVEN BEFORE THAT. AND A PRESIDENT OBAMA, JOHN McCAIN, AND LINDSEY GRAHAM, DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. SO WITH HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DEMOCRATS, IF THEY WANT TO COMPLAIN AND WANT TO BLAME PEOPLE. MAYBE THEY SHOULD BLAME BARACK OBAMA. I DON'T THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE BEING SINCERE. I THINK WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS SCORE CHEAP POLITICAL POINTS. LISTEN TO WHAT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR SAID AT TODAY'S HEARING.  >> THE NOTION THAT THE ELECTED LEADER OF THIS COUNTRY WILL PUT JULIAN ASSANGE ON A PEDESTAL COMPARED TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE MILITARY, THAT IS SO DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE COMMUNITY, I THINK IT SHOULD BRING ABOUT THE HUMAN CRY, WHETHER YOU ARE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, THEY ARE SHOULD BE HOWELLS AND MARK MY WORDS, IF THE ROLES WERE REVERSED, THERE WOULD BE HOWLS FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.  >> Sean: OF COURSE PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP SAW THIS COMING AND HE TWEETED... IT IS FOR THE PEOPLE TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS AS TO THE TRUTH, THE MEDIA LIES TO LOOK LIKE IT WOULD BE AGAINST INTELLIGENCE WHEN IN FACT I AM A BIG FAN. MR. TRUMP HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN COMING OUT ABOUT THE ELECTION HS HEARING PROVES THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS RIGHT TO PUSH BACK AGAINST E LEFT'S UNTRUE CLAIMS. JUST TO REMIND YOU VIEWERS OF WHAT WIKILEAKS DID IN FACT REVEALED DURING THE 2016 ELECTION, WE ARE GOING TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN AGAIN. FULL SCREEN, ON THE SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN SO YOU CAN BE REMINDED OF WHAT WE DID LEARN FROM WIKILEAKS AS HIS EIGHT YEAR. HAS BEEN DOING NOTHING TO STOP CYBER ATTACKS. GOING ON. FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, LAURA INGRAHAM, THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS, WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS. EVERY GOVERNMENT AGENCY HAS BEEN HACKED. NOT A PEEP OUT OF OBAMA. NOTHING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

FOR EXAMPLE, OPERATING PROCEDURES FOR CAMP DELTA, GITMO, THEY RELEASED THE CLASSIFIED VIDEOS OF A SERIES OF ATTACKS IN BAGHDAD. TWO REPORTERS WERE KILLED. THE WAR LOGS WERE RELEASED, DIPLOMATIC CABLES WERE RELEASED. WIKILEAKS RELEASED THE GITMO FILES. THE SYRIA FILES. AND THEN FOUR YEARS LATER, THE DNC FILES. NOBODY CARED ABOUT THAT. WHY DO THEY CARE ABOUT THE DNC WHICH IS NOT EVEN A GOVERNMENT AGENCY?  >> OBVIOUSLY THE BROADER EFFORT HERE IS TO CAST DISPERSIONS ON VILLAGES ME OF LEGITIMACY OF HIS VICTORY. THEY WILL GO WITH THE STORY FOR AS LONG AS THEY CAN KEEP IT ALIVE. AND THROUGH OTHER MEANS AND EFFORTS BY THE LEFT OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. THIS IS NOT GOING TO STOP WITH THIS STORY. I DON'T HAVE ANY VIEW ABOUT WHETHER THE RUSSIANS WERE INVOLVED. WHO KNOWS. THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES --  >> Sean: I DON'T KNOW EITHER. WHY DON'T THEY SHOW US THE EVIDENCE? CONGRESS HAS BEEN REQUESTING EVIDENCE. THEY WON'T EVEN GO TO THE HEARING WITH IT. JULIAN ASSANGE IS ADAMANT ABOUT IT. SAYING THEY KNOW.  >> THEY WERE VERY LIGHT ON ANY EVIDENCE BACKING UP THEIR CLAIM THAT RUSSIA, THE DNI IS SAYING, SEAN, WILL BE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT RELEASING MESSAGES AND SOURCES. WE ARE GOING TO DECLASSIFY AS MUCH AS WE CAN BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE OF THE SENSE OF NATURE OF ALL THIS.  >> Sean: WHERE WAS THE URGENCY WHEN NASA WAS HACKED, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE WHITE HOUSE?  >> YOU NAILED IT, THOUGH. THAT WAS EMBARRASSING TO THE DEMOCRATS. NOW, THEY THINK IS EMBARRASSING TO TRUMP. OR EMBARRASSING TO HIS VICTORY OREGON, SLIDING HIS VICTORY.  \n",

      "Megyn: BREAKING TONIGHT, WE ARE WAITING FOR AN FBI NEWS CONFERENCE IN FORT LAUDERDALE INTERNATIONAL, AFTER A GUNMAN KILLED AND INJURED EIGHT OTHERS THIS AFTERNOON. WE WILL CONTINUE WATCHING IT AND WE WILL GET IT TO THE MOMENT IT STARTS. WE'RE ALSO TRACKING NEW REACTION FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA AND PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP AFTER THEY RECEIVED SEPARATE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS ON THE U.S. INTELLIGENT REPORT CONCLUDING THAT RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN ORDERED HIS SPY AGENCY TO INTERFERE IN THE AMERICAN 2016 ELECTION WITH THE GOAL OF HELPING MR. TRUMP. HERE IS MR. OBAMA TAKING A HARD LINE AGAINST HIS SUCCESSOR TODAY.  >> I THINK THAT WHAT IS TRUE IS THE RUSSIANS CONTINUED TO METAL -- AFTER MY YOURSELF THAT WE ARE ON THE SAME TEAM. VLADIMIR PUTIN IS NOT ON OUR TEAM.  >> Megyn: CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CATHERINE HERRIDGE IS HERE WITH US ON THAT.  >> THIS REPORT IS VERY STRONGLY WORDED. MANY OF THEM ARE AT THEY HAVE VERY HIGH CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THAT MEANS IT'S IN, OR A. MULTIPLE SOURCES BACK UP THE FINDING. BUT IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE INFORMATION AS FACT. THE REPORT SAYS THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN ORDERED THIS IN 2016. THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND PUTIN DEVELOPED A CLEAR PREFERENCE FOR DONALD TRUMP. IT DOES NOT SAVE PUTIN ORDERED DAY-TO-DAY LEAKS. WHAT JULIAN ASSANGE TOLD FOX NEWS EARLIER THIS WEEK, PUTIN WAS NOT HIS SOURCE. THE REPORT SAYS OTHERWISE. IT REPORTS THAT THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE PROVIDED THE RECORDS AND WIKILEAKS WAS A TRACK RECORD OF EVIDENCE. EVEN THE RUSSIAN SADA CERTAIN PT -- THE RUSSIAN INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN BEGAN TO FOCUS MORE ON UNDERMINING HILLARY CLINTON'S PRESIDENCY. IT WILL GET WORSE NEXT TIME, MEGYN.  >> Megyn: CATHERINE HERRIDGE, THANK YOU. ASSOCIATED PRESS SAID DONALD TRUMP \"LEARNED A LOT\" IN THE BRIEFING. MOMENTS AGO ON THIS CHANNEL, KELLYANNE CONWAY SUGGESTED THAT THE INTEL COMMUNITY HAS BECOME POLITICIZED. FORMER MICHIGAN CONGRESSMAN SERVED AS HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND IS A FORMAL ADVISOR TO THE TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM. GOOD TO SEE YOU, CONGRESSMAN. THIS MAKES IT PRETTY CLEAR. LET ME ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ACCEPT THE CONCLUSION OF THE 17 AGENCIES. AND THAT IT CAME AT THE DIRECTION OF VLADIMIR PUTIN.  >> LET ME MAKE THREE POINTS, MEGYN. IT WASN'T ALL 17 AGENCIES. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HITS YOU VERY, VERY QUICKLY. IT WAS ONLY THREE OF THE AGENCIES. DHS DID NOT -- DOES NOT HAVE ITS NAME ON THE REPORT. THE DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY DOES NOT HAVE ITS NAME ON THIS REPORT. IT'S ONLY THREE AGENCIES. THIS IS A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM AND HOW THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY DOES ITS ANALYSIS. I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT TONY SHAFFER WAS TALKING ABOUT RED TEAM. I THINK AN INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS, IS TO ALWAYS HAVE A RED TEAM THAT PROVIDES A DISSENTING POINT OF VIEW. THAT IS MISSING IN THIS REPORT AND THIRDLY, IF THE REPORT IS FIVE PAGES, ABOUT ONE PAGE OF THAT FIVE PAGES TALKS ABOUT PROPAGANDA AND IT IS BASED HEAVILY ON THE REPORTING OF RT TELEVISION. THAT STANDS FOR RUSSIAN TELEVISION, SO IT'S HARD TO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT IS PROPAGANDA. IF YOU'VE EVER WATCHED THE PROGRAMMING, IT'S PRETTY MUCH A JOKE. IF THE EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE OUR CAMPAIGN, THAT'S WHAT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS THE BEST THAT RUSSIA CAN DO, IN TERMS OF PROPAGANDA, THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT TO DO.  \n",

THAT AS FIRMLY AS WITH THIS REPORT POINTS OUT THAT SAYS YES, THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS OF THIS THAT ARE TRUE. BUT I THINK THERE IS ENOUGH CAVEATS HERE THAT YOU DON'T WALK AWAY AND SAY WOW IT, THEY NAILED THIS AND THEY HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK.  >> Megyn: CATHERINE HERRIDGE SAYS THEY ARE A+ INTELLIGENCE. BUT WHY? WHY ARE THEY SO CONFIDENT?  >> THEY CLAIM IT'S A+ INTELLIGENCE IN THVEN'T SEEN THA THAT SAYS THEY REALLY HAVE OR THEY REALLY HAVEN'T. THEY CLAIM THAT.  >> Megyn: GOT IT. PETE HOEKSTRA, THANK YOU, SIR. MO ELLEITHEE, FOUNDING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. LONGEST TITLE EVER. HE'S FROM GEORGETOWN. SUPER SMART. WHY, JUST AS A POLITICS MATTER, WHY WAS HE SO -- IF THIS HAS BEEN A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AND THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- DO THINK FORMER CONGRESSMAN PETE HOEKSTRA WOULD HAVE GONE ON ABOUT WHY THE NEED TO DOUBT IT? EXPLAIN WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE.  >> AFTER THE IRAQ FIASCO, THEY ADDED THIS LEVEL OF HIGH CONFIDENCE, MIDDLE CONFIDENCE, LOW LEVEL. IN ALL PRESIDENTIAL, INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS, IF THERE DISSENTING VIEWS AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THAT WAS IN THE CLASSIFIED REPORT. IF THERE IS NO DISSENT IN THE REPORT, IT'S BECAUSE NO ONE DISSENTED. SO THEY SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED ALL OF THAT INFORMATION. BUT I THINK THE POINT THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE MAKING WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE IS THE ISSUE HERE IS NOT WHETHER RUSSIA TRIED TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION, THERE ARE REPORTS OF THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT SINCE THEY WERE IN THE SOVIET UNION.  >> Megyn: ARE YOU REALLY SHOCKED BY THAT?  >> THE QUESTION IS NOT THAT THEY TRIED, THE QUESTION IS, DID THEY SUCCEED? AND THE ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY NO NOT. RUSSIA DID NOT SET UP A PRIVATE SERVER IN HILLARY CLINTON'S BASEMENT AND PUT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON IT.  >> Megyn: SHE SAID THE BEST STUFF BUT THEY EXPOSED IT. BAD STUFF. YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP DID NOTHING AT ALL? THERE IS NOTHING TO FIND THERE?  >> WHAT I'M SAYING IS I DON'T THINK THIS WAS THE TIPPING POINT IN THE ELECTION IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM. MOST OF THESE STORIES THAT HURT HILLARY CLINTON WERE BROKEN BY \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\"  >> Megyn: THE PODESTA STUFF. DOESN'T THIS SEEM, THIS INTEL COMMITTEE REPORT, CONCLUDE THAT RUSSIA DID FAIL? THEY TRIED AND EVEN THEY APPARENTLY REALIZED OH, WE DIDN'T MAKE IT.  >> I THINK THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES HERE. DID THEY TAMPER WITH THE ACTUAL ELECTION?  >> Megyn: NO.  >> NOBODY SAYS THEY DID. ELECTION MACHINES, THEY DIDN'T MESS WITH ELECTION DAY. BUT DID THEY INFLUENCE THE ELECTION ITSELF? I'M NOT A DEMOCRAT THE BELIEFS WHAT RUSSIA DID IS WHY HILLARY CLINTON LOST. THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS WHY SHE LOST. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THEM. THE DNC HACK HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE SERVER. THE PODESTA HACK HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE SERVER. THEY WENT IN, THEY LINK TO THIS INFORMATION.  >> Megyn: THE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION, MO, SHE IS LOOKING PRETTY GOOD UP UNTIL -- SHE WENT UP AND SHE WENT DOWN. BUT THE JIM COMEY LETTER CAME OUT, WITH ANTHONY WEINER. HER NUMBERS STARTED TANKING, THE DEMOCRATS FREAKED OUT AND THEN SHE LOST.  \n",

DID THEY NOT DONALD TRUMP EVERY SINGLE DAY ATTACK HILLARY CLINTON BASED ON EMAILS THAT WERE OBTAINED FROM THIS RUSSIAN HACK IT? YES. IF IT WASN'T INFLUENTIAL, AND E WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED.  >> THAT WAS A MINOR PART. BY THOSE EMAILS CAME OUT, HER REPUTATION IS CORRUPT AT ARCTIC AMOUNT. THIS WASN'T FAKE NEWS. THIS WAS REAL NEWS. THIS WAS REAL NEWS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANTED TO SEIZE.  >> Megyn: IT'S DISTURBING TO HAVE RUSSIA MESSING WITH OUR ELECTION.  >> THE PRESIDENT-ELECT ISN'T SHOWING THAT SAME LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION.  >> Megyn: HE IS TRYING TO GET ALONG WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN.  >> ON THE HILL, THEY ARE SHOWING THE SAME LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION OVER THIS. WE KNOW THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION, THIS IS NOT ABOUT DISCREDITING DONALD TRUMP, THIS IS FINDING OUT WHAT RUSSIAN DID AND EVERY REPUBLICAN WILL BE ON BOARD WITH THAT.

GREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH. WELL, OUR PRODUCER AT THE FORT LAUDERDALE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT SAID THE CONFERENCE MAY START AT ANY MOMENT. THEY WERE A LITTLE LATE. THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE THIS WELL WITHIN THE LAST HOUR. SO FAR, NOTHING. PLUS, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD TO SHOUT DOWN MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY WHEN THEY OBJECTED TO DONALD TRUMP'S WIN.

THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, EVERY DEPARTMENT, EVERYTHING HAS BEEN HACKED AND THIS HAS GONE ON FOR ALL THE YEARS OBAMA HAS BEEN IN OFFICE. WIKILEAKS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR TEN YEARS. AND YET, THESE POLITICIANS HAVE DONE NOTHING. SO WHO ARE WE REALLY TO BLAME HERE? I'VE GOT THIS REPORT IN FRONT OF ME, I READ IT COMPLETELY. THIS WHOLE INTELLIGENCE REPORT. AND I READ IT, IT'S EMBARRASSIN EMBARRASSING. THEY KNOW THE METHODS AND THEY R COMPARING, REASSESSING. AND MY ARGUMENT BACK IS, WHY HAVEN'T THEY DONE MORE TO STOP THIS?  >> ABSOLUTELY, NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. WE ARE FACED WITH AN INFORMATION WARFARE ASSAULT. AND I THINK THIS LATEST RETORT FROM THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY CONFIRMS THAT. THE CLEAR -- THIS WAS NOT ABOUT POLITICS, THIS WAS ABOUT UNDERMINING THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES. IT WAS A RUSSIAN LED INTELLIGENCE OPERATION INVOLVING BOTH CYBER AND LEAKS AND INFLUENCE OPERATIONS. IT WAS LED AND DIRECTED BY VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO VIEWS THE UNITED STATES AS THE MAIN ENEMY OF RUSSIA.  >> Sean: I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME BECAUSE THIS IS SO TOPIC A IN EVERYBODY'S MIND. WHAT IS THE CONCLUSION YOU COME TO US TO MARK BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE BOOK IS ABOUT.  >> WE ARE FACING AN INFORMATION WAR BECAUSE WE ARE BEING DISARMED IN THIS BATTLE, THIS WAR. WE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW METHODS, NEW INSTITUTIONS, NEW CAPABILITIES. WE NEED CLEAR THINKING. CLEAR STRATEGY. AND WE NEED TO COUNTER ATTACK. WE NEED TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THESE ENEMY STATES THAT ARE WAGING INFORMATION WARFARE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.  >> Sean: DR. GORKA, I ASSUME YOU AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT. THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT TELLS YOU WHAT?  >> SEAN, I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE VIEWERS OUT THERE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT CYBER HACKING, THIS ISN'T ABOUT PODESTA'S PASSWORD BEING PASSWORD. BILL IS AN OLD FRIEND. THIS IS INFLUENCE OPERATION, THIS IS POLITICAL WARFARE, THIS IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS. LATIMER PUTIN IS LAUGHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED, THAT HE IS ACCUSED THE AMERICAN ELECTORAL SYSTEM AS BEING SOMEHOW CORRUPTIBLE. WHEN IN FACT, NOTHING HAPPENED IN TERMS OF STEALING AN ELECTION. BUT HE IS SO -- THE FACT THAT RT, THE RUSSIAN TELEVISION STATION IS MENTIONED SO MUCH TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW. THIS IS INFLUENCE OPERATION, SEAN.  >> Sean: THE PRESIDENT EVEN USED STATE DEPARTMENT FUNDS TO ACTUALLY FUND AN EFFORT INSIDE OF ISRAEL WITH HIS OWN POLITICAL OPERATIVES ON THE GROUND AND IF ISRAEL TO DEFEAT PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT WHAT AN OUTRAGE, OUR PRESIDENT DID IT.  >> DEFINITELY. I'VE COVERED THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SINCE THE EARLIEST STATE. IN THE VERY EARLY PART OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHEN THEY WERE DOING SO-CALLED RUSSIA RESET. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WERE PROHIBITED FROM SAYING ANYTHING CRITICAL ABOUT RUSSIA OR PUTIN. AND THAT WENT ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT IN THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT EARLIER WAS THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT IT. HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET SOME ACTION NOW. AND TAKE SOME STEPS TO COUNTERACT THESE LIES AND DISINFORMATION.  >> Sean: BECAUSE OF REALITY, DR. GORKA IS RUSSIA AND CHINA AND IRAN AND NORTH KOREA, FRIENDS AND ADVERSARIES ARE ALL HACKING US.

DID SOMEONE JUST WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE GRIND? THEY ARE ATTACKING US ALL DAY IN ALL FORMS. CHINA IS EATING OUR LUNCH IN THE CYBER DOMAIN. SO YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT IS TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE REALITY. HOPEFULLY JANUARY 20TH IS WHEN THE ADULTS GET BACK IN CONTROL AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DOUBLE STANDARDS OR FANTASYLAND ANYMORE.  >> Sean: UNBELIEVABLE. I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR INSIGHT TONIGHT. TWO VERY BIG STORIES THAT WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW ALSO TONIGHT, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID RELEASE ITS INTELLIGENCE REPORT ON ELECTION HACKING. TRUMP IS CALLING OUT THE CHARADE FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS. A POLITICAL WITCH HUNT AND THAT IS TONIGHT'S OPENING MONOLOGUE.  >> Sean: 'S OF THE OFFICE OF DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE RELEASED A DECLASSIFIED VERSION OF ITS REPORT ON ELECTION HACKING AND OF COURSE, RUSSIA'S INTENTIONS. IT CONCLUDES THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN ORDERED AN EFFORT TO TRY TO DAMAGE HILLARY CLINTON IN AN ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE ELECTION. HOWEVER, NOW THIS IS KEY, THE REPORT FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT ACTUAL VOTES WERE TAMPERED WITH AND IT DID NOT ASSESS THAT THERE WAS AN IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP GOT THE CLASSIFIED REPORT RLIER TODAY AND AFTERWARDS HE PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT WITH HIS MEETING WITH INTEL OFFICIALS WAS CONSTRUCTED AND HE SAID THE LEFT DEAN ACTING BACK... UNLIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE WILL ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM BY APPOINTING A TEAM TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO FIGHT OR TO STOP FUTURE CYBER ATTACKS. MIKE PENCE ELABORATED ON THIS PLAN, THIS IS EARLIER TONIGHT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.  >> THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTION IN THE EARLY DAYS OF OUR NEW ADMINISTRATION. TO COMBAT A CYBER ATTACK AND PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THIS TYPE OF INTRUSION IN THE FUTURE.  >> Sean: ALSO EARLIER TODAY, HE CALLED OUT DEMOCRATS FOR TRYING TO UNDERMINE HIS PRESIDENCY BY TELLING \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\"... CHINA HACKED OVER 20 MILLION NAMES. HOW, COME NOBODY TALKS ABOUT TT THAT? PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ALL BUT IGNORED CYBER SECURITY THREATS. WE ARE LIKE THE HACKING CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP, HE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AS WE TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT, THE PRESIDENT, THE DEMOCRATS, THEY HAVE BEEN ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL WHEN IT COMES TO CYBER SECURITY. TAKE A LOOK AT THE COUNTLESS MAJOR CYBER SECURITY ATTACKS ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS ALL HAPPENED SINCE 2009 WHEN OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT. THERE IS MUCH MORE. THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUMPING OUT THIS ENTAIL REPORT AS A SMOKING GUN THAT PROVES RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE SELECTION WAS A BIG REASON WHY DONALD TRUMP WON. WHAT THE LIBERAL MEDIA WON'T TELL YOU ABOUT THE REPORT AND WHAT'S IN IT, IT CONTAINS EVIDENCE ABOUT RUSSIA TRYING TO METAL IN U.S. ELECTIONS GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2008. AND THAT'S NOT ALL. NBC NEWS IS REPORTING THAT THE CLASSIFIED VERSION SHOWS THAT RUSSIAN HACKERS, THEY TARGETED THE WHITE HOUSE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE JOINT CHIEFS, CHIEF OF STAFF AND AMERICAN COMPANIES. WHY ALL OF A SUDDEN OUT OF NOWHERE -- AS HAS BEEN GOING ON THE ENTIRE OBAMA PRESIDENCY IS NOW SUCH A PRESSING ISSUE? THIS PROVES THAT THE ONLY REASON PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATS CARE NOW ABOUT CYBERSECURITY IS BECAUSE THEY NEED AN EXCUSE TO EXPLAIN WHY HILLARY CLINTON LOST. THE SORE LOSERS, SNOWFLAKES, AND THE MIKE LIBERALS, THEY CAN ONLY BLAME THEMSELVES. THEIR GROSS NEGLIGENCE ON CYBERSECURITY FOR THIS ELECTION HACKING. TAKE A LOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN. THE REASON HIS EMAILS WERE ACCESSED WAS BECAUSE OF A TYPO IN A REPLY FROM A CAMPAIGN I.T. STAFFER ABOUT A PHISHING EMAIL THAT PODESTA RECEIVED. HE GAVE THEM THE INFORMATION. WIKILEAKS FOUNDER JULIAN ASSANGE TOLD ME EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT SECURITY FROM PODESTA'S EMAIL WAS SO LAUGHABLY INADEQUATE THAT A 14-YEAR-OLD COULD HAVE HACKED INTO IT. AND THEN, HILLARY CLINTON. REMEMBER HER PRIVATE SEMI PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER? DOES THAT SOUND SECURE TO YOU? CLINTON'S SET UP WAS SO CARELESS THAT THE FBI IS 99% SURE THAT UP TO FIVE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ACCESS TO IT. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE DNC. REMEMBER? AFTER THE POLITICAL PARTY WAS HACKED, THEY DIDN'T GIVE THE FBI DIRECT ACCESS TO IT SERVER AND ITS DATA. SO THE FBI WAS FORCED TO RELY ON A THIRD PARTY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED. AND \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" THAT REPORTED THAT WHEN THE FBI FIRST CALLED DNC STAFFERS TO ALERT THEM OF A POSSIBLE CYBER ATTACK, THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A PRANK CALL. THEY DID NOTHING. AND WHEN THE FBI KEPT CALLING AND CALLING FOR WEEKS FOLLOWING, THE D&C CONTINUED TO FAIL TO ACT AND THE PROBLEM. SELECTIVE MORAL OUTRAGE HERE. IF YOU WOULD HAVE JUST DONE YOUR JOB AND FIXED THE HACKING PROBLEM THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT BACK IN 2008 AND 2009, RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE FOR YEARS, THIS NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. HERE'S REACTION, RUDY GIULIANI. MR. MAYOR, YOU DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE ON A DAILY BASIS. TO ME, THIS IS A REAL CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER THAT WE HAVE IGNORED FOR OVER TEN YEARS. AM I WRONG ABOUT THAT?  \n",

I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED FOR MANY YEARS AT TRYING TO WARN CORPORATE OFFICIALS, INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUALS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ABOUT THE HACKING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON. AND THE REALITY IS, YOU NEED BOTH TECHNOLOGICAL SOFTWARE SOLUTION LIKE BLACKBERRY PROVIDES AND OTHERS DO. YOU NEED LEGAL SOLUTIONS AND WE HAVEN'T PAID ATTENTION TO IT. AND I'VE BEEN BLUE IN THE FACE GIVING SPEECHES OVER THIS. MUST HAVE GIVEN AT LEAST 300 SPEECHES OVER HOW AMERICAN CORPORATIONS IN THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT IS NOW UBIQUITOUS HACKING THAT IS GOING ON. NOT JUST BY RUSSIA, CHINA, NORTH KOREA, BY OUR FRIENDS AND ALSO FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE. ALSO FOR RANSOM. THERE HAVE BEEN HOSPITALS THAT HAVE BEEN HACKED AND HAVE HAD TO PLAY MONEY SO THAT THE WHOLE HOSPITAL WASN'T TURNED ON. THE AMOUNT OF HACKING THAT GOES ON IT'S INCREDIBLE, AT THE FASTEST-GROWING FORM OF CRIME AND IF WE NEED ANYTHING ELSE TO WAKE US UP, THE DANGER TO OUR GRID IS THERE. THE HEAD OF HOMELAND SECURITY WOULD TELL YOU THAT.  >> Sean: MR. MAYOR, SINCE OBAMA HAS BEEN PRESIDENT, I MENTIONED THE 2008 ELECTION WHICH THIS REPORT REFERENCES. BUT THEY TRIED TO INFLUENCE AT ELECTION. OF COURSE, OBAMA TRIED TO INFLUENCE THE ISRAELI ELECTION. THAT MAKES HIM A HYPOCRITE. PUTTING THAT ASIDE, LEMME GIVE YOU THE LIST. THEN WE HAVE THE PENTAGON'S, NASA HAS BEEN HACKED, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, FEDERAL ELECTION COMMITTEE NETWORK, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN HACKED. THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN HACKED. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE IRS, AND IN 2014, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT. 22 MILLION PEOPLE HAD THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION HACKED AND OBAMA NEVER SAID A WORD. DIDN'T KICK OUT ANY DIPLOMATS. NO SANCTIONS. NOT A PEEP. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?  >> WHAT THAT TELLS US IS GROSS NEGLIGENCE ON THE FORM OF THE GOVERNMENT, A DANGER WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT GOING BACK TO 2003, 2004. THE HACKING NOW IS ENORMOUS. I BELIEVE IT'S THE HEAD OF THE FBI THAT SAID AMERICAN CORPORATIONS ARE IN TWO CATEGORIES. THOSE THAT I HAVE BEEN HACKED AND THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN HACKED AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT YET. SOME OF THESE HACKING'S, BY THE WAY, WENT ON FOR A YEAR OR TWO OR THREE YEARS BEFORE THEY WERE CAUGHT. BECAUSE THE COMPANIES INVOLVED AND THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INVOLVED DID NOT BRING IN THE EXPERTS, THE SOFTWARE EXPERTS, THE ANALYTICAL EXPERTS. AT A FAST ENOUGH PACE.  >> Sean: THE REASON THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ALL THE HACKING ALL THE YEARS PRIOR WAS BECAUSE THESE EMAILS OF THE D&C AND JOHN PODESTA SHOWED RACISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA. ANTI-SEMITISM. AND THEN WE HAVE OF COURSE, THE MEDIA COLLUDING. THEN THE CORRUPTION OF THE CLINTON'S. ALL THE MONEY THEY MADE. THEN THEY TOTALLY RIGGED THE DNC PROCESS IN FAVOR OF HILLARY OVER BERNIE. SO THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT HAS GARNERED THEIR ATTENTION HERE.  >> THAT'S REALLY THE POINT OF THIS, SEAN. THE POINT IS THIS. THAT REPORT SHOWS THE ELECTION WAS NOT HACKED. NO VOTE WAS CHANGED. IF, IN FACT, WHAT THE RUSSIANS, IF THEY DID IT, OR WHOEVER DID IT, IF ANYONE ELSE AT HAD HACKD INFORMATION THAT WAS PERFECTLY NEUTRAL AND DID NOT SHOW SOME TERRIBLE ACTS, SAID SOME TERRIBLE THINGS. SUGGESTED SOME TERRIBLE ACTIONS TAKEN BY PEOPLE, THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM HERE. IT'S THEIR ACTIONS THAT CAUSED WHATEVER PROBLEM WAS CAUSED AND AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, IT REALLY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON THE BOAT. VOTE.

TAKE A LOOK. IT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT VERY MANY PEOPLE ON TV TRYING TO CONFUSE THE VOTERS AND THEIR VIEWERS BY CONFLATING ANY ALLEGED RUSSIAN HACKING OF THE ELECTION RESULT. VLADIMIR PUTIN DID NOT TELL HILLARY CLINTON TO LOSE HER MORALS IN PENNSYLVANIA.  >> THAT'S JUST BOGUS. HE WON, FAIR AND SQUARE. FAIRLY AND CONVINCINGLY. RUSSIA DIDN'T TELL HILLARY NOT TO GO TO WISCONSIN, THEY DIDN'T PUT THE SERVER IN HER BASEMENT OR ON ANTHONY WEINER'S LAPTOP. HE WON THE ELECTION FAIR AND SQUARE CONVINCINGLY.  >> Sean: HERE NOW WITH REACTION IS MIKE HUCKABEE AND LARRY ELDER. GOVERNOR HUCKABEE, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE STILL IN ISRAEL. I KNOW YOU WERE THERE THIS WEEK AND OUR PRESIDENT TRIED TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION AGAINST PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU.  >> SHAWN, I'M WAITING ON THE SENATE. ON THE WAY THAT WE INVOLVE OURSELVES AS A U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE ISRAELI ELECTION. LIKE THEY THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED IN RUSSIA. 350,000 TAX DOLLARS FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS SENT TO A GROUP CALLED ONE VOICE. IT WAS USED FOR VOTER LIST AND DATABASES AND ALL OF IT WAS INTENDED TO GET RID OF BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. THEN THEY HELPED TO RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN 2015 IN ORDER TO DEFEAT BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IN A FOREIGN ELECTION. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE IS THE SENATE OUTRAGE ABOUT THAT? THAT'S NOT ALLEGATIONS, THAT'S NOT DECLASSIFIED. THAT IS INFORMATION. BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE HAD TO ACCEPT.  >> Sean: LARRY, THERE IS ANOTHER COMPONENT TO THAT. TAXPAYER DOLLARS WERE USED THERE. $350,000. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT THAT'S MONEY FROM HARD-WORKING AMERICANS THAT THIS PRESIDENT USED TO INFLUENCE ON ELECTIONS. AGAINST I MIGHT ADD, OUR CLOSEST ALLIES.  >> WE ALSO FOUND OUT BECAUSE DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVES WERE LITERALLY SENDING AGITATORS TO INTERFERE WITH DONALD TRUMP RALLIES AND SENDING PEOPLE TO VARIOUS STATES WHO COULD NOT VOTE THERE LEGALLY. THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF AMBUSHING THAT THEY ARE APPARENTLY NOT CONCERNED ABOUT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS DONALD TRUMP STOMPED AT THEM, THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THIS VOTE.  >> Sean: HE'S WATCHING. HE'S GOING TO NOTE THAT YOU CALLED HIM A GREG ARIAN. THEY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS MAN WON.  >> Sean: GOVERNOR HUCKABEE IS LAUGHING. GOVERNOR, I JUST WILL SAY THIS. ALL THESE INSTANCES THAT I WENT OVER WITH FORMER MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI, THIS HAS BEEN OUT THERE, THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING. AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD A PEEP. AND EVEN WORSE THAN THAT, THEY'VE DONE NOTHING TO FIX IT. THIS OUGHT TO BE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE IN MY OPINION.  >> IT REALLY SHOULD. I HAD DINNER LAST NIGHT IN ISRAEL, BUT I AM BACK IN THE STATES NOW. WITH TWO ISRAELI GENERALS, TO COLONELS, ONE OF THE GENERALS WAS A MAJOR PLAYER IN ISRAELI CYBER SECURITY. AND IT SAID, THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T TAKE THIS AS SERIOUSLY AS THEY NEED TO. AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE GOING TO BE FIGHTING A WAR IN THE FUTURE. AND WE HAVEN'T MADE IT A PRIORITY. I HOPE WE DO AND I HOPE DONALD TRUMP WILL.  \n",

      "Bill: \"IMPACT SEGMENT,\" THE PUTIN TRUMP CONTROVERSY. THERE ARE TWO STORIES HERE. FIRST ONE, RUSSIA DID TRY TO CREATE CHAOS IN THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND PUTIN KNEW ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ANCIENT RUSSIA, AS WE ALL KNOW. BUT HE COULD HAVE DONE THAT LAST AUGUST. HE WAITED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE, I BELIEVE, SO THAT PUTIN ISSUED A REPRISAL, HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT, THE NEXT PRESIDENT WOULD. THAT IS SPECULATION, I ADMIT IT. THERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA NOT STEPPING UP EARLIER WHEN U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND KNEW THE RUSSIANS WERE HACKING INTO THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL MACHINE. SECOND STORY, WHETHER THE HACKING INFLUENCE THE VOTE. HERE, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY. I BELIEVE FEW AMERICANS MADE THEIR VOTING DECISION BASED UPON WHAT CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER JOHN PODESTA SAID IN EMAILS. HOWEVER, TO BE FAIR, THE HACKING SITUATION DIVERTED THE PRESS AND GOT A LOT A COVERAGE. SO, YOU COULD SAY, OR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IT CUT INTO THE TRUMP BASHING BY THE PRESS, WHICH IS ALMOST NONSTOP. JOINING US NOW WITH HIS ASSESSMENT, BRIT HUME IS IN FLORIDA THIS EVENING. NOW, FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU THINK TRUMP IS BEING TOO SOFT ON PUTIN?  >> YEAH, I THINK HE PROBABLY IS. LOOK VLADIMIR PUTIN IS A BAD ACTOR. TWO PRIOR PRESIDENTS, TWO OF TRUMP'S IMMEDIATE PREDECESSORS TRY TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH HIM. IT DIDN'T WORK IN EITHER CASE. I THINK TRUMP WILL EVENTUALLY FIGURE THIS OUT. BUT'S, SO FAR, I THINK HE NURSES THIS NOTION THAT HE, BY VIRTUE OF HIS PERSONALITY AND HIS WAY, WILL BE ABLE TO STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH PUTIN AND TO DO BUSINESS WITH HIM. MAYBE HE CAN. BUT I DOUBT IT. I THINK YOU WILL FIGURE IT OUT BEFORE LONG.  >> Bill: ALL RIGHT, SO, THE INTENT, WE KNOW, IS FOR THE UNITED STATES TO HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA.

NOW, ON THE E-VOTING SIDE OF THE HACKING CONTROVERSY, DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WENT TO THE POLLS AND SAID, I AM VOTING FOR TRUMP BECAUSE OF JOHN PODESTA? DO YOU KNOW ANYONE?  >> NO. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WHO IS SERIOUS ABOUT THIS BELIEVES THAT THE HACKING OF THE EMAILS AFFECTED ULTIMATELY THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. HER HOWEVER, AS I THINK, BILL, WHATEVER COVERAGE THOSE EMBARRASSING EMAILS DID NOT HELP THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. IT IS WORTH POINTING OUT HERE, WOULD YOU KEEP HEARING THIS TALK ABOUT HACKING THE ELECTION OR INTERFERING IN THE ELECTION, IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT THEY TRIED TO INTERFERE OR AT LEAST INFLUENCE THE CAMPAIGN. OBVIOUSLY, THERE WAS NO EFFECT ON THE VOTING, IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL ELECTION DAY EXERCISE OF PEOPLE'S FRANCHISE. I SIMPLY DIDN'T OCCUR.  >> Bill: YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND, ALL THE REPORTAGE SAYS THAT PUTIN DIDN'T LIKE HILLARY CLINTON. AND WANTED TRUMP TO WIN. ALL RIGHT. SO, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR. TRUMP WINS AND WHO DOES HE PUT AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE? PERHAPS, THE TOUGHEST GUY, ANTI-RUSSIAN GUY, HE DOESN'T HATE RUSSIA, HE IS NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY NONSENSE FROM RUSSIA. WHEREAS, HILLARY CLINTON NEVER WOULD HAVE PUT A PERSON LIKE THAT AND SECRETARY OF WAR POSITION. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE POSITION. NEVER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SOFTER, SECULAR, NONMILITARY GUY. I AM TRYING TO THINK, WHY WOULD PUTIN WANT TO DO A TOUGHER GUY, TRUMP, THEN HILLARY CLINTON? DO YOU KNOW?  >> WHAT I THINK HAPPENED, BILL, EVEN WITH THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SEEMS TO THINK I'M A E HILLARY CLINTON AND DIDN'T LIKE SANCTIONS THAT WERE IMPOSED AND DIDN'T LIKE HER. HE STARTED BACK IN 2015 WITH THIS EFFORT, WHICH WAS INTENDED TO DISCREDIT HER BELIEVING THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT. SO, HE WAS SEEKING TO WEAKEN HER. THAT MAKES A CERTAIN KIND OF SENSE. AT THAT POINT, OF COURSE, NO ONE RECOGNIZED THAT TRUMP WAS GOING TO COME TO THE FLOOR, BE THE NOMINEE, AND ULTIMATELY, BE ELECTED. OBVIOUSLY, AS TRUMP ADVANCED, IT BECAME HARD TO TELL WHERE THE LINE COULD BE DRAWN BETWEEN HURTING HER AND HELPING HIM BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT HURT HER HELPED HIM ONCE IT BECAME ONE-ON-ONE BETWEEN THEM. IN THE END, HE GOT TO SOMEONE HE PREFERRED, BUT I THINK HE MAY BE RIGHT, BILL, YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS. THE TRUMP APPOINTMENTS, MATTIS IN PARTICULAR, AND HIS INTELLIGENCE AGENCY APPOINTEES, SUGGEST TO ME, THAT THE HONEYMOON WITH RUSSIA, SUCH AS THAT IS, WILL NOT LAST VERY LON LONG. SPEED WHEN I LOOK AT GEOPOLITICS AND I SAY, OKAY, YOU CAN NEVER REALLY UNDERSTAND THE TRUE MOTIVES BECAUSE PUTIN IS NEVER GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT HE DID OR WHAT HE DIDN'T DO. BUT NOW, THIS IS BEING USED TO DENIGRATE, THIS IS MY LAST QUESTION FOR YOU, TRUMP'S VICTORY. SO, THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE TRUMP ARE SAYING, THE ONLY REASON HE WON WAS BECAUSE OF PUTIN AND PUTIN'S HACKING. AND THAT IS IT TOO.  \n",

THEY HAD DISCREDITED THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, THEY HAVE WEAKENED THEIR CREDIBILITY. THEY'VE MADE IT HARDER TO GET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THEM WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING SERIOUS TO SAY. IT'S AN ABSURDITY. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT OBAMA IMPOSES SANCTIONS A WEEK BEFORE HE GETS A REPORT? AND THEN EXPECTS US TO BELIEVE THE REPORT MATTERS? THIS IS A POLITICAL CHARADE. IT IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW THE LEFT TO SAY THAT TRUMP IS NOT REALLY PRESIDENT BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS DID IT. HILLARY DIDN'T REALLY LOSE, THE RUSSIANS DID IT. FRANKLY, I THINK IT'S JUST STUPID. I THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA ONCE AGAIN TO UNDERMINE AMERICAN SECURITY BY DISCREDITING THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND ASKING HIS HANDPICKED POLITICAL APPOINTEES TO GO OUT THERE AND SAY THINGS THAT THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY BACKUP. THESE REPORTS ARE PATHETICALLY INADEQUATE. FRANKLY, THEY ARE SO GENERALLY DON'T MATTER MUCH. WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH CYBER -- DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME. WITH NORTH KOREA, THE CHINESE, ET CETERA.

AMBASSADOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT.  >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, TUCKER.  >> Tucker: PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP'S POSITION SEEMS TO BE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SHARE THIS VIEW, A LOT OF THE STUFF IS COMING FROM DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEES IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THEY DON'T LIKE THEM, THEY FAVOR HILLARY CLINTON AND THEY ARE TRYING TO UNDERMINE HIM BEFORE HE EVEN TAKES OFFICE.

BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN A MUCH FIRMER POSITION THAN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID. AND I THINK THAT WE WILL, IF WE DO THAT, WE HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING ALONG REASONABLY WELL WITH THE RUSSIANS. BUT IF WE BEHAVE THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT DID DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE RUSSIANS WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. I NEGOTIATED WITH THEM FOUR TIMES ON FOUR MAJOR TREATIES OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. THREE OF THOSE TIMES THEY WERE STANDARD RUSSIAN BEHAVIOR, DOER, UNHELPFUL, PREVARICATING, ET CETERA. ONE OF THE FORM WAS TERRIFIC. IT WAS RIGHT AFTER THE BERLIN WALL WENT DOWN. IT WAS NOT MUCH MY NEGOTIATING SKILLS THAN THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCED AS A RESULT OF THAT.

IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT OUR FREE PRESS BRIEF PRAYER AND GIVING ANY KIND OF EXPOSURE TO ALLEGATIONS THAT SMEAR A PERSON, ANY PERSON, IS WRONG. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE IN A REPORT OR ANYWHERE ELSE. IF THERE IS NO BACKER, NO FACTS TO INDICATE THE ALLEGATIONS MAY HAVE SOME CREDIBILITY, THEY SHOULD NOT BE PUBLISHED. I HOPE WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT. NOW, ONTO WHAT HAPPENED TO DONALD TRUMP. IN SEPTEMBER OF 2015, SOMEONE HIRED A WASHINGTON POLITICAL RESEARCH FIRM, FUSION GPS, TO DIG UP DIRT ON MR. TRUMP. TAKING THE MONEY, THE COMPANY BEGAN ITS SORDID QUEST. A FEW MONTHS LATER, SOME DEMOCRATS WHO SUPPORTED HILLARY CLINTON ALSO BEGAN TO TAKE FUSION FOR DIRT. IN JUNE, 2016, FUSION HIRED A RETIRED BRITISH INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, CHRISTOPHER STEELE, TO GET THAT DIRT. APPARENTLY, HE TALKED TO SOME RUSSIAN OPERATIVES AND BEGAN ISSUING A SERIES OF MEMOS BASED ON THE GOSSIP THAT HE HEARD. IN AUGUST OF 2016, ABC'S BRIAN ROSS REPORTED YESTERDAY, THOUGH SALACIOUS MEMOS WRITTEN BY STEELE FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE FBI. THEN COME ON HALLOWEEN, APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH, FAR LEFT MAGAZINE RAN A STORY ABOUT THE ANTIDRUG OPERATION. THE NATIONAL MEDIA DID NOT PICK IT UP. TO ITS CREDITORS. ONE WEEK AGO, JANUARY 5TH, PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BRIEFED ON RUSSIA'S EFFORT TO INFLUENCE THE U.S. ELECTION. AND THE ANTI-TRUMP GARBAGE WAS INCLUDED AND THAT INTEL BRIEFIN BRIEFING. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID TODAY THAT THE PRESIDENT QUESTIONED WHY THE GOSSIP WAS EVEN INCLUDED IN THE BRIEFING AND HE WAS NOT PLEASED. THAT IS TO MR. OBAMA'S CREDIT. THE NEXT DAY, DONALD TRUMP RECEIVED THE SAME INTELLIGENCE FROM FOUR SENIOR U.S. INTELLIGENT CHEATS DOMAIN CHIEFS. THAT IS WHEN ALL HELL BROKE ROSE. ALSO, RECEIVING INFORMATION, EIGHT CONGRESSPEOPLE. PAUL RYAN, NANCY PELOSI, MITCHELL MACCONNELL, ADAM SCHIFF, RICHARD BURKE, AND MARK WARREN. A SHORT TIME LATER, CNN RECEIVED A LEAK THAT THE SALACIOUS ANTI-TRUMP STUFF WAS PRESENTED TO OBAMA AND TRUMP. THEN, BUZZFEED PRINTED THE SALACIOUS STUFF. NOW, A BUNCH OF THE ALLEGATIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCREDITED. NONE CONFIRMED. NONE. YET, SOME ARGUE THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SEE ALL THE GARBAGE EVEN THOUGH IT CERTAINLY HURTS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HIMSELF. SO, YOU, AS AN HONEST AMERICAN, MUST DECIDE, DO YOU WANT TO SALACIOUS TRASH IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE DISTRIBUTED BY THE MEDIA? DO YOU? THERE ARE NO RULES ANYMORE. ALLEGATIONS BECOME CONVICTIONS. GOSSIP AND INNUENDO BECOME FACT. STANDARDS ON THE INTERNET AND FOR MUCH OF THE ESTABLISHED MEDIA NO LONGER EXIST. DONALD TRUMP HAS DENIED ALL OF THE ACCUSATIONS, IS ANGRY, AS WE SAW YESTERDAY. AND THE LONG RUN, IT IS AMERIGO WHO SHOULD BE ANGRY. THIS KIND OF STUFF IS HARMING THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY, OUR POLITICAL STRUCTURE, AND/OR ABILITY TO EVALUATE INFORMATION IN A FAIR WAY. FACTS SHOULD BE REPORTED. BASELESS ALLEGATIONS PAID FOR BY POLITICAL ASSASSINS SHOULD NOT. UNLESS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED TO BACK THEM UP. PERIOD. AND THAT IS THE MEMO.

AGAIN, PEOPLE IN YOUR BUSINESS, GOT TO FIND WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR COUNTRY AND THEE THAT A REPORT HAS BEEN BRIEFED BY THE PRESIDENT, THERE IS NO FOUNDATION IF IT'S TRUE OR NOT, TO ME, SEEMS TO BE A DISSERVICE.  >> Bill: IF YOU ARE RUNNING A NETWORK, SINCE FOX NEWS HAD THIS INFORMATION, WE TALK TO THE REPORTER TODAY WHO GOT IT LAST SUMMER, WE DID NOT PUT IT OUT, THAT WAS A DECISION MADE BY FNC. I THINK IT WAS A RIGHT DECISION. DO YOU?  >> I AM NOT IN YOUR BUSINESS BUT I WOULDN'T PUT OUT ANYTHING --  >> Bill: WE DIDN'T EVEN MENTION, IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM. OKAY, LET'S GET ON TO YOU AND DONALD TRUMP.  >> ME AND THE DONALD.  >> Bill: YOU'RE NOT FRIENDS AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT.  >> WE ARE NOT ENEMIES, EITHER.  >> Bill: ALL RIGHT. SO, RUSSIA, YOU HAVE A GREAT INTEREST IN RUSSIA. AND YOU HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT CRITICAL OF TRUMP TRYING TO FOSTER A RELATIONSHIP WITH PUTIN. TRUMP SAYS IT IS BETTER FOR US TO BE FRIENDS WITH PUTIN. BUT IF HE DOESN'T PLAY ALONG, I'M GOING TO BE HIS WORST ENEMY. DO YOU SEE ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY THAT TRUMP IS DOING WRONG VIS-A-VIS VLADIMIR PUTIN?  >> YEAH, THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY, IT HAS BEEN HARD FOR HIM TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE RUSSIANS HACKED INTO --  >> Bill: HE HAS.  >> IT'S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY THAT REINFORCES THE NARRATIVE AND THE MINDS OF THE RUSSIANS AT THIS GUY WANTS TO PLAY BALL. ALMOST, HE WANTS THE RELATIONSHIP TOO MUCH. HERE'S WHAT I PREFER THE PRESIDENT-ELECT DO. I HAVE BEEN BRIEFED, I BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS DID IT, THEY WILL PAY A HEAVY PRICE. IT WAS A DEMOCRAT TODAY, COULD BE THE REPUBLICANS TOMORROW, AND THE DEFENDER OF DEMOCRACY, THE PROTECTOR OF FREEDOM. NO FOR AN ENTITY IS GOING TO INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS WITHOUT PAYING A PRICE. DECLARE PUTIN'S THE MAN HE REALLY IS. HE IS A DISRUPTIVE FORCE.  >> Bill: IF HE DOES BECOME A SENATOR, THEN, HE ALIENATES PUTIN FROM THE TRUMP. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS STRATEGY IS TO SAY, LET'S START AFRESH. LET'S KNOCK THIS OFF AND WORK TOGETHER TO DEFEAT ISIS AND NOT HAVE TENSIONS. ISN'T THAT MORE WORTHY, TO TRY THAT, THEN TO THREATEN HIM RIGHT FROM THE JUMP?  \n"

      "THANKS FOR WATCHING US TONIGHT, I AM BILL O'REILLY. PLEASE ARE A NUMBER THAT THE SPIN STOPS RIGHT HERE. WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.  >> Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.\" TODAY, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE ANNOUNCED IT WILL BE CONDUCTING AN INQUIRY INTO THE FBI AND DOJ'S PRE-ELECTION INVESTIGATION OF HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAILS. REMEMBER THAT? WE ARE GOING TO TALK TO A FORMER OFFICIAL ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND WHY. WE WILL ALSO TALK TO CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, DOES IT EXPOSE THE DEEPER ROD IN THE AMERICAN PRESS? THANKS FOR COMING ON. WHY ARE WE REOPENING THIS MUSTY BOX? WHAT DON'T WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?  >> WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN OFFICIALLY IS WHETHER HIS BEHAVIOR WAS APPROPRIATE. THERE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO ARGUE THAT HE VIOLATED A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RULES, FIRST BY SPEAKING PUBLICLY ABOUT SECRETARY CLINTON AND CONDEMNING HER CONDUCT WHEN THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE CHARGE CHARGES. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S JOB IS TO LOOK AT THAT AND THEN PASS JUDGMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT WHAT HE DID WAS APPROPRIATE.  >> Tucker: I DON'T THINK THAT'S A CRAZY POINT TO MAKE IN THAT HE BASICALLY PASSED JUDGMENT ON SECRETARY CLINTON'S BEHAVIOR. AND SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO RESPOND. I THINK IT'S OKAY TO SAY YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS THAT. BUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS BEGAN AS YOU'LL REMEMBER, THE ONLY REASON IT WAS PUT IN POSITION TO DO THAT WAS BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, LORETTA LYNCH, MET ON THE TARMAC. SHE WAS INVESTIGATED IN THIS INVESTIGATION. FROM WHAT I COULD TELL FROM THE ANNOUNCEMENT, THAT'S NOT EVEN MENTIONED. SOMETHING LOOKING INTO. HOW CAN YOU SKIP THAT?  >> GOOD QUESTION. SHE DID SORT OF RECUSE HERSELF. I THINK THERE QUESTIONS FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TOO. BUT JIM COMEY WAS THE PRIME MOVER IN THIS CASE. AND HAVE THIS PRESS CONFERENCE. HE MADE THE DECISION TO SEND THAT LETTER AGAINST THE ADVICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND OTHER SENIOR POSITIONS.  >> Tucker: I THINK IT MATTERS. THE ONLY REASON HE HAD TO MAKE THAT DECISION WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WASN'T MAKING IT. BECAUSE SHE HAD THAT MEETING. FIRST OF ALL, THAT MEETING, IF YOU ARE LOOKING INTO CORRUPTION FOR THE CAMPAIGN WOULD BE THE RED FLAG. THAT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE OUTRAGEOUS INITIATIVE. WHY WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THAT? I DON'T WANT TO THINK OF IT IS S PARTISAN BUT I THINK IT IS.  >> ONE, THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE INVESTIGATION GOT THE RIGHT RESULT. THEY EXPECT INSPECTOR GENERAL T GOING TO LOOK AT JIM COMEY'S MOTIVATION, IN THE SAME WAY YOU WOULDN'T LOOK AT LORETTA LYNCH'S MOTIVATIONS. TAKING THAT MEETING WITH BILL CLINTON HAS AND LED HER TO STEER THE OUTCOME ONE DIRECTION.  >> Tucker: WHY?  >> THERE HAVE BEEN NO CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS.  >> Tucker: CREDIBLE ENOUGH THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS WELL, I AM BACKING OFF FROM THIS INVESTIGATION PERSONALLY.  >> BOTH AT THE FBI AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, THAT THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY CHARGES BROUGHT, THAT REALLY WAS PUT TO REST. WHAT REMAINS OPEN AT LEAST IN AN OFFICIAL STANDPOINT IS WHETHER JIM COMEY ACTED APPROPRIATELY. YES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL KIND OF RECUSED HERSELF. BUT THAT IS A MAIN JIM COMEY CAN VIOLATE ALL THE RULES.  >> Tucker: I DON'T THINK IT IS CRAZY OPINION. TO DISCREDIT DONALD TRUMP'S VICTORY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. THE POINT OF THIS WHOLE THING IS THERE IS A CLOUD OVER IT. IT WAS UNFAIR. THAT IS THE POINT. WHY IS THAT A POINT THAT AMERICANS SHOULD PAY FOR WITH THEIR TAX DOLLARS?  \n",

      ">> I THINK THERE IS A CLOUD OVER HIS VICTORY, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IS LOOKING AT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHY HE IS DOING IT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAME ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY, THERE IS SEVERAL THINGS HE'S LOOKING INTO THE GO TO DEMOCRATIC OFFICIALS. I THINK AN UNFAIR QUESTION ABOUT AN OFFICIAL WHO -- ANDREW McCABE IS LOOKING INTO THAT TOO. THINGS ON BOTH SIDES.  >> Tucker: LOOK, I'M GLAD THAT YOU CAN SEE YOU THINK TRUMP IS POTENTIALLY ILLEGITIMATE. YOU TWEETED... HE SAID AGAIN, I AM NOT SURE WHY IT'S NOT OKAY TO QUESTION TRUMP'S LEGITIMACY. HE WAS ELECTED BUT IT WASN'T FAIR AND SQUARE. IN WHAT SENSE WAS IT NOT FAIR AND SQUARE AND WHY WOULD YOU WRITE SOMEONE LIKE THAT AS A FORMER PUBLIC OFFICIAL?  >> THE NATION'S TOP INVESTIGATED OFFICIAL, JIM COMEY, 11 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION -- YOU HAD AN INTERVENTION BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT THAT WAS SEEKING TO SUBVERTS OUR DEMOCRACY.  >> Tucker: JEFF ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL? JEFF ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT THAT AFFECTED THE ELECTION?  >> WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO POLITICALLY SAY, DEFINITIVELY SAY, YOU CAN SEE A FOUR-POINT JOB IN CLINTON'S POLL NUMBERS IN THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION.  >> Tucker: I KIND OF ASSUME, EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY. DID RUSSIA ANYWAY AFFECT THE OUTCOME?  >> IF YOU LOOK AT THE THINGS TOGETHER, THE TIMING OF COMEY'S LETTER, THE CONTINUED STORIES THAT WERE COMING OUT THROUGH WIKILEAKS TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN THE LAST 30 DAYS OF THE ELECTION AND THEN YOU LOOK IN IN THE LA1 DAYS, WHEN ALL THOSE WERE COMING TO THE FOREFRONT --  >> Tucker: BUT YOU ARE DODGING MY QUESTION. NAME ONE SPECIFIC WAY THAT RUSSIA AFFECTED THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION AND GIVE ME ONE EVEN SCINTILLA OF EVIDENCE THAT THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  >> THIS IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU ASSUMED INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE CORRECT IN THEIR ASSUMPTIONS.  >> Tucker: YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT IS TRUE.  >> YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE RIGHT. IF YOU ASSUME THAT, THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF THE ELECTION. WE HAD TRUMPET REPEATEDLY TALKING ABOUT WIKILEAKS OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. IT WASN'T SO EFFECTIVE, WHY WAS IT TALKED ABOUT ALL THE TIME? HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TALKING TO VOTERS ABOUT ALL THE TIME. OF COURSE YOU CAN NEVER LOOK AND SAY THERE ARE A MILLION THINGS --  >> Tucker: BUT YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE AT ALL.  >> LOOK AT THE TIMING OF CLINTON'S DROPS IN THE POLLS, AND THE LAST 11 DAYS. I'M NOT SAYING RUSSIA BY ITSELF. I'M SAYING RUSSIA COMBINED WITH --  >> Tucker: THIS IS WHAT'S FRUSTRATING HERE. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HAS HAD AN EFFECT ON THE ELECTION. YOU ARE SAYING IT'S NOT FREE AND FAIR WHICH IS A VERY BIG CLAIM FOR SOMEONE WHO IS WIDELY BELIEVED, LIKE YOU, A PUBLIC OFFICIAL. MRS. CLINTON DIDN'T HAVE AN ECONOMIC MESSAGE. HUGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY IGNORED HER APPEALS. WOULD BE MORE FRUITFUL TO SAY LET'S GET THAT ECONOMIC MESSAGE AND LISTEN TO THE MIDDLE CLASS.  >> I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE TWO THINGS AT ONCE. I THINK YOU CAN POINT TO MISTAKES THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MADE. ALL OF THAT CAN BE TRUE AND SHE COULD STILL BE HEADED TO WIN. I SAW THEIR FORMER SPOKES PERSO PERSON --  >> Tucker: I'M NOT A SHRINK, SO I HATE TO MAKE A DIAGNOSIS OF YOU AND YOUR PARTY. I SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENRAGED, DEEP DENIAL, DO YOU SEE THAT?  \n",

      ">> NO.  >> Tucker: [LAUGHS]  >> THEY TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE, IT WASN'T CLEAR ENOUGH. THE SPOKESPERSON WAS TALKING ABOUT TODAY SAYING THAT. I JUST SAID IT ONE MINUTE AGO. THAT DOESN'T MEAN --  >> Tucker: THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN SAY IT'S NOT FREE AND FAIR.  >> THEY MADE MISTAKES AND THEY STILL WERE HEADED -- LESS' LEAE THAT ASIDE FOR ONE SECOND. THE FACT THAT WE ARE DEBATING WHETHER COMEY HAD AN IMPACT OR NOT, HE SHOULD NEVER BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.  >> Tucker: TODAY WE HAVE A NEW INVESTIGATION INTO THIS WHOSE ONLY PURPOSE IS TO MAKE DEMOCRATS FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS NOT OUR FAULT. LET ME ASK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION. DO YOU THINK JIM COMEY ACTED AND HE SPOKE FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, ACT AS A WAY THAT WAS PARTISAN.  >> I THINK HE BELIEVED SO MUCH IN HIS OWN INTEGRITY, IT CROSSES LINE INTO SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LEADS TO MISTAKES. THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE IN D.C.  >> Tucker: THAT'S TRUE. FOR MORE OF THE INTERNAL DOJ ELECTION, WE ARE JOINED BY FOX NEWS CHIEF OF CORRESPONDENCE, CATHERINE HERRIDGE.  >> THEY MADE THE DECISION TO LOOK AT A BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE ELECTION AT JUSTICE AS WELL AS FBI. THE RELEASE MAKES CLEAR THAT THEY ARE LOOKING VERY DIRECTLY AT FBI DIRECTOR COMEY, HIS POSITION TO SEND A LETTER TO CONGRESS 11 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION. THAT HE WAS REOPENING THE CLINTON EMAIL CASE AND ALSO HIS PUBLIC STATEMENT IN JULY THAT THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT LAWS MAY HAVE BEEN BROKEN BUT CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO PURSUE A PROSECUTION OF HILLARY CLINTON. THE REASON THAT IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING WITHIN THE FBI JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT YOU DON'T TAKE PUBLIC ACTION RIGHT BEFORE AN ELECTION.  >> Tucker: INTERESTING. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL GO IN TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.  >> IT'S KIND OF LIKE LAYING LANDMINES FOR THE INCOMING IT ADMINISTRATION. THIS GIVES THE EMAIL CASE IS A SECOND WIND AND IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS TO COMPLETE. WHAT REALLY STRIKES ME, TUCKER, IS THAT IN THE PRESS RELEASE TODAY, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION OF THE MEETING BETWEEN LORETTA LYNCH AND BILL CLINTON. THAT CAME JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE HILLARY CLINTON INTERVIEWED INTO JULY. THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE FOR SOME CONTEXT, THAT WAS THE EVENT THAT REALLY SET INTO MOTION A SERIES OF EVENTS THAT SORT OF BOXED THE FBI DIRECTOR IN. AFTER THAT MEETING, LORETTA LYNCH SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM JUST GOING TO ACCEPT THE FBI DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION, ULTIMATELY RECUSING HERSELF BUT NOT FULLY RECUSING HERSELF. SHE LATER SAID IT SHOWED A LOT OF VERY BAD JUDGMENT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.  >> Tucker: CAN THEY EXPECT ARE GENERAL INITIATE ONE OF THESE REPORTS? AT WILL?  >> HE REALLY HAS A LOT OF LATITUDE AND THEY OPERATE VERY INDEPENDENTLY AND AT THE CATALYST APPEARS TO BE A SERIESE SENATE ABOUT THE EMAILS, AND THESE ISSUES COME UP THE LETTERS REALLY DEAL WITH ISSUES ACROSS THE POLITICAL DIVIDE. IT'S NOT JUST REPUBLICANS MIGHT NOT CHEER OR FEAR THIS INVESTIGATION BUT ALSO DEMOCRATS AND A LONG TIME FBI CONTACTS AT NIGHT, ONCE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL GETS THEIR FOOT IN THE DOOR, NOTHING IS REALLY OFF THE TABLE. IT CAN REALLY OPEN -- REOPEN HOW INFORMATION WAS HANDLED BY HILLARY CLINTON. WE DON'T WANT THEM IN THE DOOR.  \n",

      ">> Tucker: NOT IF WE ARE PRESIDENT. CATHERINE, THANKS A LOT. IT'S NOT AN ELECTORAL SETBACK, IT'S BEEN A PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOP AND AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. IN THE INTERCEPT, THE AMERICAN DEEP STATE, HAS AN EFFECT GONE TO WAR WITH DONALD TRUMP? WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT FROM RIO DE JANEIRO. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I JUST WANT TO RESTATE FOR OUR VIEWERS WHO MAY NOT VIEW YOU, YOU ARE NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU SAY THAT PRETTY EXPLICIT YEARLY. YOU WATCHED THIS DOSSIER LEAK INTO THE AMERICAN MEDIA AND YOUR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WAS THIS COMES FROM THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND HERE'S WHY. I WANT TO PUT THIS ON THE SCREE SCREEN. MUCH OF WHICH REFLEXIVELY REVERES, SERVES, AND BELIEVES WITH HIDDEN AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS. THE DEMOCRATS, SEEMINGLY DIVORCED FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM REASON WITH EACH PASSING DAY. ARE WILLING, EAGER, TO RAISE ANY CLAIMS. BOY, THAT IS QUITE AN INDICTMEN INDICTMENT.  >> I THINK IT IS WARRANTED. YOU SEE DEMOCRATS AT THIS POINT, EVEN LIBERALS, MORE OR LESS OPENLY CALLING FOR AND CHEERING FOR THE INTERVENTION O CIA, THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THE OVERALL DEEP STATE HOPING THAT BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO DO SO THAT THIS UNELECTED FACTION IN WASHINGTON WILL UNDERMINE AND SUBVERT HIS PRESIDENCY BEFORE HE HAS EVEN BEEN INAUGURATED. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS ACTUALLY QUITE DANGEROUS. THERE REALLY IS IT'S AT THIS POINT, OBVIOUS WARFARE AGAINST THIS UNELECTED BUT VERY POWERFUL FACTION THAT RESIDES IN WASHINGTON AND SEES PRESIDENTS GO ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE. THERE IS CLEARLY EXTREME CONFLICT AND A LOT OF SUBVERSION TAKING PLACE.  >> Tucker: SO YOU WRITE CORRECTLY I THINK, THE CIA IN PARTICULAR WAS OPENLY AGAINST TRUMP GOING BACK A FULL YEAR. WHY IS THAT? WHY DO THEY OPPOSE TRUMP?  >> I THINK THERE A LOT OF REASONS. I THINK THE NUMBER ONE FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITY OF THE CIA OVER THE LAST FOUR TO FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN THE PROXY WAR THEY ARE WAGING IN SYRIA TO REMOVE ASSAD. HILLARY CLINTON WAS QUITE CRITICAL OF OBAMA FOR CONSTRAINING THEM. TO IMPOSE A NO-FLY ZONE. TRUMP TOOK THE EXACT OPPOSITE POSITION. HE SAID WE HAVE NO BUSINESS IN SYRIA, WE OUGHT TO LET RUSSIA AND ASSAD TO GO FREE IN KILLING ISIS AND WHOEVER ELSE THEY WANT TO KILL. HE WAS A THREAT TO THE CIA'S PRIORITY. CLINTON WANTED TO MUCH MORE CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH. WHERE'S TRUMP WANTED BETTER RELATIONS. I THINK THEY VIEWED TRUMP AS A THREAT TO THEIR INSTITUTIONAL ABILITY TO GET THERE AGENDA IMPOSED ON WASHINGTON.  >> Tucker: WHAT IS SILLY ABOUT THIS IS YOU POINT OUT, WHICH I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO OUR VIEWERS, READING THIS. YOU RECOMMEND SOME OF THE WAYS TO OPPOSE TRUMP. BUT THIS WAY IS AN ILLEGITIMATE WAY TO OPPOSE A PRESIDENT AND IN FACT A THREAT TO OUR SYSTEM. IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEANT.  >> SURE, I MEAN IF YOU GO BACK SIX DECADES WHEN DWIGHT EISENHOWER, NO RADICAL OF HEAT, A FIVE-STAR GENERAL, TWO-TERM REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. HE HAD ONE CHANCE TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS HE WAS RIDING OFF INTO THE SUNSET, AND HE SAID THE GREATEST DANGER WE FACE IS DEMOCRACY IS THIS FACTION OF MILITARY AND INDUSTRIAL POWER UNELECTED BUT PERMANENTLY EXHORTING POWER. THERE BECOMING MORE POWERFUL AND ALL OF US A SUDDEN IT DOES MATR WHAT CHOICES WE AS AMERICAN CITIZENS MAKE. I THINK ACTUALLY IN THE ELECTION WHAT YOU SAW WAS THIS KIND OF FRAMEWORK WHERE THERE WAS A PROXY WAR. YET FACTIONS WITHIN THE FBI, VERY SUPPORTIVE OF DONALD TRUMP, UNDERMINING HILLARY CLINTON'S CANDIDACY AND THEN YOU HAD THE CIA ITSELF, VERY STRONGLY BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON. I THINK IT IS QUITE DANGEROUS IF WE START THINKING ABOUT SUBMITTING TO RULE BY THESE UNELECTED DARK DEEP STRAIGHT OVERLORDS. I THINK IT'S THE ANTITHESIS OF DEMOCRACY.  \n",

      ">> Tucker: IS ALSO THE STORY OF THE REST OF THE WORLD. IN OTHER PLACES, THIS IS THE STORY OF THE MIDDLE EAST. THE REAL POWER RESIDES IN THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  >> OBVIOUSLY THE UNITED STATES, PART OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY FOR MANY DECADES HAS BEEN, AND UNELECTED ONE, IS TO EMPOWER THE MILITARY, EMPOWER THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WITHIN THAT COUNTRY TO REMOVE THAT GOVERNMENT, IMPOSE THEIR OWN POLICIES. THAT IS SOMETHING AMERICANS OUGHT TO BE EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT. I'M WORRIED BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE ARE THINGS DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO DO THAT ARE QUITE BAD. I WANT TO SEE DEMOCRATS FOCUS ON THOSE IN A RECENT AWAY AND NOT CHEER AND ROOT FOR THE CIA TO USE THEIR DIRTY TACTICS TO UNDERMINE THE PRESIDENT THAT JUST GOT ELECTED.  >> Tucker: ENTIRELY FAIR POINT. WHY IS IT THAT THE PRESS WHICH YOU WOULD THINK AFTER ALWAYS SCENE IN THE LAST COUPLE DECADES, IS SO WILLING AND EAGER TO BELIEVE WHATEVER THEY ARE FED BY ANONYMOUS INTELLIGENCE SOURCES CUSTOMER >>  I KNOW IT'S UNORTHODOX BELIEF, ORGANS LIKE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" OR LABEL AND A LOT OF WAYS THEY MAY BE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES, ESPECIALLY IN THE POST 9/11 ERA, YOU SEE THIS INCREDIBLY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MEDIA AND THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. THEY HAD TO APOLOGIZE TO LAUNDERING ANONYMOUS CLAIMS THAT HELPED THE SAUDI IRAQ WAR, THERE IS THIS FEAR. INSTITUTIONAL FEAR CHALLENGING OR QUESTIONING PEOPLE WHO HAVE METALS ON THEIR CHEST. PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE CIA, FOR LOOKING UNPATRIOTIC. THEY OFTEN GET A LOT OF BENEFITS WHEN THEY SERVED THEIR AGENDA. THEY GET SCOOPS, SECRETS, ACCESS. I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT THE MEDIA HAS BEEN ALIGNED AGAINST TRUMP AND WILL SIDE WITH ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO SUBVERT HIM. INCLUDING THE CIA.  >> Tucker: WHEN THEY EMPOWER THE UNELECTED TO CONTROL OUR DEMOCRACY, IT'S DANGEROUS. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TONIGHT. TIME NOW FOR TWITTER STORM, OUR MOST POWERFUL WEATHER PATTERNS. DONALD TRUMP PROMOTES A POLARIZED REACTION AND HE OFFERED HIS PERSONAL ENDORSEMENT OF L.L. BEAN, THEY GAVE MONEY TO A TRUMP SUPER PACKED. THIS MORNING, TRUMP TWEETED THI THIS... NOT EVERYONE AGREED WITH THAT. OTHERS, THOUGH, JOINED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IN THAT COMPANY. THAT IS TONIGHT'S TWITTER STORM. LINDA BEAN WILL BE ON THE SHOW WITH US IN JUST A MINUTE. UP NEXT, TRUMP CALLED THE BUS FEED A FAILING PILE OF GARBAGE.

NOW I AM SURE THAT I AM NOT ALONE IN SAYING THAT I BELIEVE THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS, IF TRUE, DEMAND MORE AND STRONGER SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA.  >> Tucker: SO THIS STUFF GETS INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AND ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY, STOMACH.  >> THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OF REDUNDANCY. WE HAD HOURS AND HOURS OF TESTIMONY ALL WEEK. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THIS QUOTE IT. IT'S SO SILLY THAT I THINK I GOT IGNORED. AND CORRECTLY. THIS IS NOT NEWS. THIS IS PROPAGANDA. WE INVENTED ALL THESE NEW WORDS, FAKE NEWS, GARBAGE. THIS IS PROPAGANDA. THE EUROPEANS HAVE BEEN AT THIS. THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN AT THIS. THEY ARE MASTERS AT THIS. FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, BEFORE THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION. AND THEY ARE THE WORLD MASTERS OF CREATING FALSE NEWS. IT'S CALLED PROPAGANDA. THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME IN EUROPE. AND EVERYBODY IS USED TO IT. WE ARE NOT THAT USE TO IT HERE BECAUSE IT'S REACHED A NEW LEVEL OF BOLDNESS. TO GO AFTER THE UNITED STATES IS SORT OF A BIG TARGET. PUTIN THOUGHT CORRECTLY THAT HE COULD DO ALL THIS WHEN OBAMA IS AROUND, WITH IMPUNITY. HE ESSENTIALLY HAS. THE SANCTIONS WERE DELAYED, HALFHEARTED, THEY WERE REALLY QUITE USELESS. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ANY OF THIS. BECAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY A FABRICATION OF THE RUSSIAN SECRET SERVICES. THEY MAKE UP NEWS ALL THE TIME. AFTER NEWS IS NOTHING BUT THIS INFORMATION. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE ARE ALL SHOCKED. WHAT IS SHOCKING IS THAT THESE PUBLICATIONS WOULD PUT IT OUT.  >> Tucker: THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. I WONDER ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON THE PRESS OF MOMENTS LIKE THIS. WE HAVE ALL BEEN ENCOURAGED TO THINK OF \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" ,\" CNN, EVEN BUS FEED AS SERIOUS NEWS OUTLETS. WE THINK THAT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW?  >> THE TIMES DID NOT GO WITH US. \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" DID NOT GO WITH US. FOX NEWS DID NOT GO WITH US. THIS. THE FACT IS THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE, I THINK REALLY WANT NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BACK UP WHAT IS IN YOUR STORY, YOU DON'T GO WITH IT. YOU DON'T JUST THROW IT OUT THERE. BECAUSE OTHERWISE, WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE A COMPLETE CHANNEL THAT SAYS RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA, PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT. BUZZFEED DID IT. I THINK THEY MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. TOTALLY INDEFENSIBLE.

I SIT ON THIS VERY SHOW I THINK IT'S BEEN PUBLICIZED. THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN POLITICIZED. IT DOES DONALD TRUMP THINK THIS IS ALL THE POLITICS?  >> I WOULD PROBABLY SAY THE ASPECTS OR SLICES OF IT MAY BE POLITICALLY CHARGED OR SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THINGS THAT ARE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED. I THINK THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. HE IS GETTING A PLETHORA OF INFORMATION WHEN HE FINDS VERY USEFUL IN TERMS OF DIAGRAMMING OUT WHAT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY POLICIES WILL BE, WHAT OUR DIPLOMATIC POLICIES WILL BE AND SO FORTH, BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE ISSUES HERE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AS AMERICANS. IF WE ARE GOING TO POLITICIZE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WE KNOW THAT JEFF SESSIONS WILL NEVER DO THAT, WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WILL NOT DO THA THAT. I'M JUST HERE TO SAY TO YOU THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW ADMINISTRATION, WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE, YOU AND I PLAYED A LOT OF SPORTS TEAMS, WE ARE TEAM ORIENTED, WE NEED TO PASS THE BALL, OPEN OURSELVES UP TO EACH OTHER, AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  >> Eric: LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT JAMES COMEY. \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\" SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD RESIGN. IF HE DOESN'T RESIGN, INCOMING JEFF SESSIONS SHOULD ASK FOR HIS RESIGNATION. IF HE WON'T, MR. TRUMP SHOULD FIRE HIM. IT'S BEEN A POLITICAL FOOTBALL GOING BACK AND FORTH. THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING GET RID OF HIM, ALL ALL OF A SUDDEN INE BRIEFING ROOM, HE SAID WE HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE IN JAMES COMEY. WHERE IS DONALD TRUMP AND THE FBI WITH COMBING?  >> I DO THINK HE'S A MAN OF INTEGRITY. I THINK IT RELATES TO THE SITUATION. I THINK THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IS GOING TO LOOK AT A VERY CAREFULLY. I THINK THEY'VE INTERACTED A FEW TIMES. ONE OF THE THINGS WE BOTH KNOW THAT PRESIDENT DONALD DAY TRUMP HE COULD TAKE MEASURE OF A PERSON PRETTY QUICKLY. WHAT ALSO LOVE ABOUT HIM, HE'S GOING TO MAKE HIS OWN DECISION. HE'S NOT GOING TO LET \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\" MAKE THE DECISION OR THE PARTISAN POLITICS AND WATCHING TO MAKE THAT DECISION. HE'S GOING TO MAKE MEASURES HIMSELF AND GOING TO COME TO A CONCLUSION ON THAT. HERE'S SOMETHING JAMES, AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT OF. IF SOMEDAY WOULD ASK HIM TO RESIGN, HE WOULD DO IT BECAUSE HE IS A GREAT AMERICAN. SHOULD IT COME TO PASS. MY GUESS IS, I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW. THIS IS UP TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT TO MAKE A DECISION AND TO DO THAT ANALYSIS.  >> Eric: ANOTHER FIGUREHEAD, JAMES CLAPPER, HE'S MAKING THE NEWS LATELY. DOES PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIM TO BE A DIRECTOR OF THE DNI?  >> I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT HE PROBABLY HAS CONFIDENCE IN HIM. LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY, A NEW ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO BE IN TOWN. YOU KNOW AND I KNOW WHEN YOU GET NEW LEADERSHIP, GOOD THINGS CAN REALLY HAPPEN IF YOU SET THE CULTURE RIGHT. I HAD A PHENOMENAL EXPERIENCE IN TRUMP TOWER AND THE LAST 60 OR 70 DAYS OR SO. THIS MAN IS A PHENOMENAL LEADER, AND EVEN PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT OPERATING AT FULL EFFICIENCY WHEN THEY HAVE A PHENOMENAL LEADER, THEY KICK IT UP A NOTCH. WE BOTH KNOW THAT FROM THE BUSINESSES OF A RUN. SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION YOU'RE GOING TO SEE AND UPLIFT AND A LOT OF FACETS FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  >> Eric: ONE QUESTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS MR. TRUMP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDIA GOING FORWARD. THERE'S BEEN SOME CONTENTION GOING BACK AND FORTH OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

HERE'S ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES DESCRIBED IT.  >> I CAN REPORT THAT MY CONFIDENCE IN THE FBI DIRECTOR'S ABILITY TO LEAD THIS AGENCY HAS BEEN SHAKEN.  >> WAS AT A HEATED EXCHANGE AT ANY POINT?  >> THERE WAS SOME HEAT. THERE WAS SOME HEAT. A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. GOING UP SO CONGRESSMAN SHERMAN, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT MEETING?  >> THERE WERE TWO CONTENTIONS AROUND JAMES COMEY. ONE WAS 11 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, HIS STATEMENTS ABOUT HILARY'S EMAIL. IF THAT HAD AN IMPORTANT IMPACT, WHETHER HE HANDLED THAT CORRECTLY OR NOT, MOST DEMOCRATS DO NOT BELIEVE HE HANDLED IT CORRECTLY. THE SECOND ISSUE WAS THROUGH WHAT STEPS DID HE INFORM THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE THAT THEY HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO A MAJOR HACK? DEBBIE WATSON WAS THERE THAT NOBODY CALLED HER PERSONALLY. PERHAPS THEY DID A LITTLE MORE THAN CALL THE 800 NUMBER OR EVEN A VOLUNTEER. WE ARE GOING TO DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ WHO IS GOING TO HAD A BRIEFING.  >> Eric: CONGRESSMAN, I'LL JUST READ A COUPLE OF QUOTES FROM SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE WHO ARE AT THAT BRIEFING. \"I NO LONGER HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIM\" MEETING JAMES COMEY. \"I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED.\" \"I'LL JUST SAY I'M VERY ANGRY\" \" LITERALLY, IS EVERYONE THIS ANGRY ABOUT THE WAY THE DNC WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT THE INFORMATION, BUT THE EMAILS AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT'S MAKING EVERYONE THIS CRAZY, LOSING CONFIDENCE IN THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI OVER THIS EMAIL NOTIFICATION OF THE DNC?  >> COMEY HAS A 10-YEAR TERM ANYTHING THAT MANY DEMOCRATS WOULD PREFER HIM. AS TO WHETHER THE FBI MADE A SERIOUS EFFORT TO INFORM THE TOP EXECUTIVES AT THE DNC, COMEY HAS PROMISED A DETAILED BRIEFING. HE HAS ADMITTED THAT THEY NEVER CALLED THE NUMBER ONE PERSON WHO WAS DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. WHETHER THEY CONTACTED OTHER COUNSELORS WILL HAVE TO SEE. THAT'S AN ISSUE, OBVIOUSLY HIS STATEMENT 11 DAYS BEFORE INAUGURATION IS CONTROVERSIAL. I HAVE SOME LEVEL OF FAITH AND JAMES COMEY AND MORE FAITH AND GENERAL GLENN WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT.  >> Eric: ARE YOUR COLLEAGUES SUGGESTING THAT THERE'S SOME EFFICACY AND THE HAND OF THE FBI?  >> THEY'RE THERE CONCERNED ABOE DECISIONS THAT COMEY MADE AND THAT AT LEAST DIMINISHED THE DEMOCRATS CONFIDENCE IN HIM. IN MY CASE, I HAVE SOME LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN THE DIRECTOR. IT IS GOING OKAY. DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING IN THAT MEETING THAT WOULD GIVE YOU CONCERN OR PAUSE ABOUT THE INCOMING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?  >> WHAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT WILL LEAD IS WHETHER THERE WAS ANY AMERICAN WHO WAS INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING OR COORDINATING THIS RUSSIAN HACKING. I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WATERGATE. THAT WAS A MATTER OF BURGLARIZING THE FILES OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMUNITY. BACK THEN, FILES, OR IN METAL CABINETS IN MANILA FOLDERS. NOW, I SEE ANOTHER BURGLARY. FILES ARE IN CABINETS, THEIR ON EMAIL SERVERS. IF ANY AMERICAN WAS INVOLVED IN THAT, IT'S IMPORTANT. THE FACT THAT THE INTERN COMMITTEE WOULD GIVE SOME CREDENCE TO THIS 35 PAGE DOSSIER IS REASON ENOUGH TO SAY LET'S RUN TO GROUND ALL OF THE CHARGES, LET'S TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEAKED. SCOTT CONGRESSMAN, BEFORE I LOSE YOU, ABOUT 30 SECONDS, ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES CLAIMED THAT THE DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY IS NOT LEGITIMATE. WHAT SAY YOU?  \n",

THIS IS HILLARY CLINTON'S FORMER PRESS SECRETARY.  >> EVERY DAY THERE ARE NEW DEVELOPMENTS, NEW SHOE DROPPINGS SO TO SPEAK. THEY QUESTION THE LEGITIMACY OF HIS WIN.  >> Eric: ARE COMMENTS LIKE THAT A STRATEGY TO UNDERMINE HIS WIN?  >> IT LOOKS AS IF THE DEMOCRATS ON THEIR WAY OUT THE DOOR, ARE TRYING TO LEAVE BEHIND AS MANY LAND THE MAC LANDMINES AS THEY CAN TO AT LEAST CAST DOUBTS ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE TRUMPET VICTORY. ALL OF A SUDDEN AS WE HAVE SEEN IT, THEY'VE GOT INTERESTED IN RUSSIAN CYBER WARFARE WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION SEEMED TO BE NONCHALANT ABOUT UNTIL THEY LOST THE ELECTION.  >> Eric: NOW JOINING US FROM WASHINGTON, BOSTON HERALD COLUMNIST. FIRST IT WAS JAMES COMEY, THEN IT WAS THE VOTING BOOTHS, THEN IT WAS RUSSIAN AGAIN. HONESTLY CAN'T THEY JUST GET OVER A? SHE LOST.  >> IT'S A FUNNY THING, ERIC WE HAVE DONALD TRUMP COMPLAINING ABOUT HIS LEGITIMACY THAT HECHT GOT HIS HOPE POLITICAL STANDING AS A BIRTHER. IT'S A BIT RICH, OKAY?  >> Eric: THAT'S WHERE HE GOT HIS POLITICAL STANDING FROM THAT MOMENT?  >> I'M SAYING HE GOT TRACTION EARLY ON. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN, I'M TALKING ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO AT THE LEAD BIRTHER.  >> Eric: THERE WERE PEOPLE TALKING IN THE '80s THERE WERE SAYING HE WAS GOING TO RUN. ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS WIN EITHER FLORIDA, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, THROWN WISCONSIN AS WELL. SHE LOST ALL OF THOSE.  >> THE REASON SHE LOST WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS A FLAWED CANDIDATE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT RUSSIAN HACKING. THIS IS ABOUT THE CLOUD THAT HUNG OVER HEAD WITH THE FBI INVESTIGATION. SHE MISHANDLED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, SHE LET MEN AND GODS HE DIED THAT NEVER HAD DIE DIED. SHE DIDN'T RUN A GOOD CAMPAIGN IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES WHICH NEEDED TO BE. SHE SHOULD ONLY BE BLAMING HERSELF. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT RIGHT NOW THAT THEY WANT EXCEPT THAT DONALD TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND VICTORY. THEY SHOULD BE BUILDING BRIDGES, NOT TRYING TO DELEGITIMIZE HIM.  >> Eric: IS DONALD TRUMP A LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT NOW?  >> THERE ARE TWO THINGS HE YOU COULD DO TO PROVE HIS LEGITIMAC LEGITIMACY. NUMBER ONE IS TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT FACTFINDER. INCIDENTALLY, NEXT TIME HE SAYS HE HAS THIS GREAT VICTORY.  >> Eric: YOU GUYS ALWAYS DO THIS.  >> HE NEEDS TO PUT SOMEONE UNDER OATH AND SAY DIDN'T YOU DEAL WITH THE RUSSIANS DURING THE CAMPAIGN OR NOT? BECAUSE WHEN DONALD TRUMP CALLED ON PUTIN TO STEAL DATA FROM THE DNC AND FROM HILLARY CLINTON AND THEN 100 TIMES HE REFERENCED THE VERY DATA.  >> Eric: RICHARD, YOU ARE SPENDING IN THE NO SPIN ZONE. IT WAS A JOKE. MAYBE YOU CAN FIND THOSE 55,0000 EMAILS OF A FREQUENT AND DELET. REMEMBER THAT? IT WAS A JOKE!  >> WIKI ELITES DROPPED ALL THOSE EMAILS AND OUR.  >> Eric: IS ON US WILL THE CHAIR YOU'RE ON RIGHT NOW? ADRIANA, BRING US UP TO SPEED NOW.

SPECIFICALLY, ITS FBI DIRECTOR, JIM COMEY'S CONDUCT PRIOR TO THE ELECTION. THIS IS REOPENING SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY BEEN CLOSED, WE ARE JOINED APPROPRIATELY BY JAMES ROSEN. WHAT IS THIS, JAMES?  >> MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS, CONSERVATIVES AND LEGAL EXPERTS ARE QUESTIONING THE TIMING AND PARTICULARLY THE SCOPE OF THIS INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONDUCT OF JAMES COMEY. IT WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HIMSELF TWEETED BEFORE DON AND I QUOTE, WHAT ARE HILLARY CLINTON'S PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT? GUILTY AS HELL, TRUMPET SAID INVESTIGATORS WILL PROBE HIS STATEMENT ABOUT THE LENTEN INVESTIGATIONS. AND THE LETTERS THAT COMEY SENT TO CONGRESS JUST DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION. AND THEN CLOSING THE CASE AGAIN. THEY URGED COMEY TO RESIGN.  >> I THINK IT IS HARD TO BE A DIRECTOR OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT INSTITUTION WHEN THAT TRUST IS NO LONGER THERE.  >> I THINK THE FATE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE FBI ARE SOMEWHAT SHAKEN IN THEIR LEADERSHIP. THE FATE OF THE COUNTRY AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI IS SOMEWHAT PEERLESS. GIVEN ALL THAT, HE OUGHT TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIS FAMILY.  >> Tucker: LORETTA LYNCH WAS FORCED DEFECTIVELY TO RECUSE HERSELF FROM THE CLINTON EMAIL PLACE WHEN IT WAS DISCLOSED THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD MET PRIVATELY WITH FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO DELEGITIMIZE TRUMP BEFORE YOU TAKES OFFICE.  >> I THINK THEY HAVE A POINT. I MEAN, WHY NOT LOOK AT THE ENTIRE CIRCUMSTANCES HERE? WHY NOT LOOK AT WHAT ATTORNEY GENERAL LYNCH DID, HER NONRECUSAL, I THINK THAT IS ALL VERY IMPORTANT.  >> IN SHORT, TUCKER, YOU ASK ME WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? EXPERTS I SPOKE TO SAID COMEY'S CONDUCT, HIS KEY DECISIONS ARE THE KIND OF THINGS ESPECIALLY IN A SUCH A HIGH-PROFILE CASE THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WOULD INVESTIGATE. IT IS THE CIRCUMSCRIBING OF THIS CASE, THE NARROWING THAT BOTHERS CONSERVATIVES.  >> Tucker: RIGHT. WHERE IS LORETTA LYNCH'S COMPONENT. THANKS A LOT. APPRECIATE IT. HILLARY CLINTON'S DEFEAT IN NOVEMBER MIGHT HAVE PROMPTED SOME SOUL-SEARCHING IN THE AMERICAN PRESS. INSTEAD, BLAME HAS BEEN PLACED, AN ALLEGED PLAGUE OF FAKE NEWS. LAWMAKERS ARE TRYING TO USE THE SCORCH OF FAKE NEWS TO INFLUENCE KIDS IN SCHOOL. INTRODUCED A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO KEEP CIVIC -- THE GOAL TO TELL STUDENTS WHAT NEWS IS FAKE, REAL, AND SHAPE THEIR OPINIONS ACCORDINGLY. THANKS FOR COMING ON.  >> THANK YOU, TUCKER.  >> Tucker: YOU HAVE WRITTEN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT COMMANDS, IF PASSED, WILL COMMAND THE SCHOOLS TO DO THIS. THE ABILITY TO JUDGE THE CREDIBILITY AND QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION FOUND ON INTERNET WEB SITES INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA. HOW EXACTLY WILL THEY DO THAT? TO TELL FAKE FROM REAL?  \n",

THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT. PRESIDENT OBAMA ISSUED YET ANOTHER SET OF COMMUTATIONS TODAY, FOR BOTH CHELSEA MANNING AND OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA. FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED BY FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT.  >> CHELSEA MANNING WILL NOW BE SET FREE FOR COURT MONTHS FROM NOW, BRADLEY MANNING COPIED SOME 400,000 DOCUMENTS REVEALING SECRET INFORMATION ABOUT AMERICAN MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. MANNING THEN GAVE HIM MIGHT GIVE THAT INFORMATION TO WIKILEAKS WHO GAINED NOTORIETY BY EXPOSING THE NOTORIETY TO VARIOUS NEWS OUTLETS. PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THE LEAGUE ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL AND THOSE AIDED -- PUBLICIZING THE INFORMATION MEANT THAT ANYONE, INCLUDING AL-QAEDA, COULD HAVE READ IT. CHELSEA MANNING, A TRANSGENDER WOMAN, HAS NOT BEEN JAILED FOR SEVEN YEARS. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THAT WHILE THE DOCUMENTS MANNING RELEASED WERE DAMAGING TO NATIONAL SECURITY, THE ONES EDGAR EDWARD SNOWDEN RELEASED WERE FAR MORE DAMAGING. SNOWDEN CHEERED MANNING'S RELEASE, BUT TOP REPUBLICANS INCLUDING HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN, CALLED THE COMMUTATION OUTRAGEOUS.EN SOME S ARE BAFFLED. WATCH.  >> I AM REALLY SURPRISED THAT THE PRESIDENT TOOK THIS ACTION AND NOT HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT MESSAGE WE SENT ABOUT REVEALING SENSITIVE NATIONAL SECURITY DOCUMENTS.  >> IN THE MEANTIME, PRESIDENT OBAMA ALSO COMMUTED THE SENTENCE OF OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA, WHO HAS AS A MEMBER OFN WAS ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT, PLANTED MORE THAN 100 BOMBS. LOPEZ RIVERA WAS NEVER CONVICTED OF HARMING ANYONE. THE LEFT DESCRIBED HIM AS A POLITICAL PRISONER WHO WAS WRONGLY CONVICTED. TUCKER.  >> Tucker: TRACE GALLAGHER. OBAMA'S CLEMENCY MAKES SURE MANNING WILL ONLY SEND SEVEN YEARS, WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE WILL IT SEND TO OTHER SOLDIERS WHO MIGHT FEEL TEMPTED TO REVEAL OTHER SECRETS?

FIRST, THE MACRO QUESTION, TWO CLEMENCY IS GRANTED ON THE SAME DAY, ONE FOR CHELSEA MANNING, WHO BETRAYED THE COUNTRY, AND ONE FOR A PUERTO RICAN TERRORIST WHO SOUGHT TO WAGE WAR AGAINST THE COMPANY. WHAT ARE THESE HAVE IN COMMON?  >> BOTH ARE ANTI-AMERICAN. LIKE A LAST KICK IN THE TEETH AT LEAST FOR OBAMA. TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND LOOK AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE TO SAY, LOOK, THIS IS MY FINAL GASP OF, YOU KNOW, LOOK, HERE IS MY LEGACY, RIGHT? THAT WE ARE BOWING DOWN TO ORGANIZATIONS. 130 BOMBS ACROSS MULTIPLE CITIES ACROSS THE U.S., LIKE YOU SAID. PRIVATE MANNING, TREASON.  >> Tucker: IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE PRESIDENT OBAMA GRANTING CLEMENCY TO AN ABORTION CLINIC BOMBER, FOR EXAMPLE. THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE CHELSEA MANNING CLEMENCY IS APPARENTLY, THROUGH REPORTERS, SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING OF A CIVIL RIGHTS VICTORY BECAUSE CHELSEA MANNING IS A TRANSGENDER WOMAN AND THAT WE SHOULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT FOR THAT REASON. WHY SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED OR UPSET ABOUT THIS CLEMENCY?  >> PRIVATE MANNING WAS A TRAITOR IN 2013, AND PRIVATE MANNING IS A TRAITOR IN 2017. PRIVATE MANNING RELEASED MORE THAN 750,000 CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS. A LOT OF THOSE WERE THE AFGHAN WAR DIARIES, THE AFGHAN -- IRAQ WAR DIARIES. THE TALIBAN, AL-QAEDA, THEY WENT THROUGH THIS DIARIES AND LOOKED AT, WHERE DID WE GET OUR INFORMATION, WHO WERE THE SOURCES THAT WE GOT OUR INFORMATION FROM? THEY WERE ABLE TO TIE TOGETHER TIMES AND PLACES PAGE NUMBER ONE, THAT PUT LIVES AT A PLACE, REAL AFGHAN AND IRAQI SOURCES THAT WERE GIVING US INFORMATION. NOT JUST THE BACK HISTORY, BUT FOR THE FUTURE. HOW ARE WE GOING TO LOOK AT A FUTURE SOURCE ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, SYRIA, SAY, PLEASE COME TO GIVE US SOME INFORMATION BUT WE ARE A LITTLE NERVOUS NOW BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GET RELEASED TO SOME SORT OF HACKING. BY THE WAY, TUCKER, THE ABSURDITY OF THIS. THIS IS A DEMOCRAT PARTY WHO JUST RECENTLY WAS RAISING THEIR ARMS UP IN THE AIR SCREAMING ABOUT, HOLY COW, LOOK AT THE RUSSIAN HACKING. THIS GROUP OF DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN SO CONCERNED ABOUT HACKING OVER THE LAST FOUR WEEKS, NOW JUST RELEASED A GUY THAT GAVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST LEAKS TO ASSANGE IN HISTORY.  \n",

THAT'S A REDLINE YOU SHOULD NEVER ALLOW ANY FOREIGN NATION TO CROSS. IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN SOMEONE COMING UP AND ASKING ME TO DO A OR B, IT DESTROYS DEMOCRACY.

IF YOU WERE RUNNING THE PENTAGON ONCE AGAIN, WHAT WOULD BE YOUR TOP PRIORITY INTERNALLY?  >> I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO BRING SOME PREDICTABILITY IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET. YOU REALLY CAN'T DO ANYTHING IN TERMS OF REORGANIZATION OR STRUCTURING OR MAKING CHOICES ON PROGRAMS WITHOUT HAVING SOME IDEA OF HOW MUCH MONEY YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND. I HOPE THAT ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES IN THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE TO GET RID OF SEQUESTRATION AND THEN PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF STABILITY TO THE DEFENSE BUDGET. THAT MEANS GETTING AWAY FROM THESE CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS.  >> Tucker: AND YOU SAID CONGRESS NEEDS TO DO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. THERE HAS BEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS A BELIEF AMONG A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT CIA IS MORE POLITICAL MAYBE THAN MOST OF US ASSUMED IT WAS.

I THINK IT'S UP TO THEM TO SHOW HIM THE VALUE THEY CAN BRING TO HIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. I AM PRETTY CONFIDENT BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAD WITH MIKE POMPEO, HE KNOWS HOW TO FIX THAT RELATIONSHIP IT'S A GREAT ASSET FOR THE PRESIDENT. AND THEY JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT THIS RELATIONSHIP. IT'S BASICALLY THE AGENCY FIGURING OUT HOW BEST TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT. EVERY PRESIDENT HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH ON HOW HE WANTS TO GET INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION. IT IS UP TO THE AGENCY TO ADJUST TO THE PRESIDENT'S NEEDS AND DESIRES, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.  >> Tucker: THEY BEEN SAYING FOR MONTHS THAT PEOPLE AT THE CIA WERE LEAKING AGAINST THEM ON THIS QUESTION OF RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE ELECTION, GIVEN HOW CLEARLY PERSONAL THIS IS, IT SEEMS PLAUSIBLE THAT THEY WERE LEAKING DOMESTICALLY -- DO YOU FEEL THAT WAY?  >> I DON'T KNOW, TUCKER.

I THINK IT IS ESSENTIALLY -- I WOULD BE AMAZED IF THERE WERE EVIDENCE THAT IT REALLY HAD AN IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION.  >> Tucker: WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE EVIDENCE FOR SURE. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT KIND OF CAME OUT OF NOWHERE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT IT'S BEEN FRONT AND CENTER OF THE DEBATE ON THE POLICY SIDE IS MOVING THE AMERICAN EMBASSY FROM TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS SUGGESTED THEY WILL DO THAT. IS THAT IN AMERICA'S INTEREST?  >> I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL THINK ABOUT CAREFULLY. THEY MAY DECIDE ULTIMATELY TO MAKE THAT CHANGE BUT AS THEY CONTEMPLATE HAVING TO DEAL WITH IRAN, THE SITUATION IN SYRIA AS WE ARE STILL FIGHTING AGAINST ISIS IN BOTH SYRIA AND IRAQ. I THINK THEY ALSO NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF MOVING THE EMBASSY IN TERMS OF OUR POTENTIAL ALLIES OR PEOPLE WORKING WITH US IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO TRY TO DEAL WITH ISIS?

WAS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE SECRETARIES, EVEN DURING A PERIOD OF GREAT BUDGET DRAWDOWNS, LAYERED SAW TO IT THAT WE BEGAN PUTTING SEED MONEY INTO THINGS LIKE STEALTH AND OTHERS THAT THEM WERE LATER DEVELOPED BY HAROLD BROWN AND HIS SUCCESSORS.

WHY SHOULD POLITICIANS BE INVOLVED IN CRAFTING TEXTBOOKS?  >> TO ME, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND OUR HISTORY TO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT FOREIGN POLICY WE HAVE IN THE FUTURE, SO LOOKING BACK TICKETS FROM NOW, WHY ARE WE ON THE COURSE THAT WE ARE ON? MONROE DOCTRINE, THE MARSHALL PLAN, THESE ARE MOMENTS IN HISTORY THAT REALLY HELP US UNDERSTAND WHERE AMERICA LEADERSHIP HAS COME FROM.

WE HAVE NO PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPEN, AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING IS ADDING PROPAGANDA FROM A POCKET NECK POLITICIAN INTO TEXTBOOKS.

THIS WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY, BUT WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO HAS THE LEAST CURIOUS MAN ON THE PLANET OF THIS ISSUE. HE WANTS TO CHANGE THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION BY SAYING HE WON BY A LANDSLIDE, HE WANTS TO CHANGE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WENT TO HIS INAUGURATION WITH NUMBERS THAT CANNOT BE SUBSTANTIATED.

SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE PERSON. I DON'T WANT TO ATTACK YOU, BUT YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING IS THE ADDITION OF POLITICAL PROPAGANDA IN THE TEXTBOOKS. THERE IS NOTHING TO SUBSTANTIATE YOUR CLAIMS. WE DON'T KNOW RUSSIA'S EXTENT. THOSE ARE UNKNOWABLE RIGHT NOW, AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO. THEIR ASSESSMENT DOES NOT SAY THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION WAS AFFECTED BY RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE. IT DOESN'T SAY THAT, AND YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T SAY THAT, AND THEY ALSO HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THE INTENT.  >> THEY DID NOT ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THERE INTERFERENCE HAD AN OUTCOME. THEY ASSESSED WHETHER OR NOT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT PURPOSELY AND FINALLY PUTTING HIMSELF PURPOSELY INTERVENED. IF I WERE PRESIDENT TRUMP, I WOULD CONDEMN THAT INTERFERENCE, AND I WOULD SAY THAT THEY WOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT THEIR IMPACT WOULD NOT BE ON FOREIGN POLICY OTHER THAN THAT. THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE EVERYTHING HE CAN TO DENY IT, BUT WHAT HE WAS CONFRONTED WITH THE INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES ASSESSMENT, EVEN HE HAD TO AGREE THAT THEY WERE INVOLVED.  >> Tucker: YOU ARE FROM MARIN COUNTY. I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA, ANGRY RICH PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU AT COUNTIES AND SAY WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS TRUMP CHARACTER, HE'S TERRIBLE. I GET THE PRESSURE THAT YOU ARE UNDER.  >> I AM HIGHLY EDUCATED AND HIGHLY ENGAGED.  >> Tucker: I GET IT, COMPLETELY. BUT LET ME JUST ASK YOU, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL, AS A PARENT, AND I THINK YOU ARE PARENTS, IF YOUR KIDS TEXTBOOKS HAD POLITICAL CLAIMS THAT WERE NOT BASICALLY SUBSTANTIATED, CLEARLY PARTISAN, AND THEY WERE INSERTED BY SOME POLITICIAN HE DIDN'T AGREE WITH?

      "Tucker: IT'S BEEN THREE AND A HALF YEARS SINCE EDWARD SNOWDEN WALKED OFF TO RUSSIA WITH A VAST TROVE OF AMERICAN SECRETS, MORE THAN 1 MILLION PAGES OF THEM. HE STILL A HERO TOO MANY IN GROUPS LIKE ACLU AND AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CALLED UPON PRESIDENT OBAMA TO OUR NAME BEFORE LEAVING OFFICE, OBAMA DID IT. A NEW BOOK AGGRESSIVELY QUESTIONS THE IDEA THAT HE WAS ANY KIND OF HERO SAYING THAT HE DELIBERATELY SOUGHT TO STEAL AMERICAN SECRETS BEFORE ACCEPTING PUTIN'S OFFER TO DEFECT TO RUSSIA. EDWARD EPSTEIN HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO INVESTIGATING A LOT OF THINGS INCLUDING JOURNALISM, HE RELEASED HIS LATEST BOOK HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS SNOWDEN, THE MAN AT THE THEFT, EDWARD JAY EPSTEIN, GREAT TO SEE YOU. YOU POINT OUT THAT SOME WAY THE SNOWDEN DID OF THE MARKET PUBLIC A FAVOR, BUT HE'D WENT WAY BEYOND THAT AND DAMAGED AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY, WHY DIDN'T HE STOP AT A PUBLIC PART OF WHAT HE DID?  >> I THINK ONE HAS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A SILVER LINING TO EVERY CLOUD THAT THE CLOUD WAS A DARK THUNDERSTORM IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED TO AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE PURPOSELY AND DELIBERATELY INFLICTED BY SNOWDEN.  >> Tucker: IT WAS PURPOSEFUL AND DELIBERATE YOU DEMONSTRATE YOU WENT OVERNIGHT TO RUSSIA, WHAT WAS HIS MOTIVE, EXACTLY?  >> I DON'T KNOW HIS MOTIVE. I'M MORE OR LESS INTERESTED -- I'M MORE INTERESTED IN HIS ACTIONS, WHY HE TOOK THESE DOCUMENTS, 1.5 ALIEN FILES, ACCG TO THE HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE HE REMOVED THOSE FILES, HE COMPROMISED THE ENTIRE COMMUNICATIONS INTELLIGENCE OF THE WEST SHRUNK BY THAT AMOUNT. WHY DID HE DO THIS? WHAT HE DID WAS BASICALLY FLY TO HONG KONG, HE MADE A PIT STOP AT THEIR WHERE HE MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF THE POSTER BOY OF WHISTLEBLOWING FOR AMERICAN JOURNALISM. THEY NEVER COULD SEE THE WHOLE STORY, THEY NEVER ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER 1 MILLION TO 440,000 DOCUMENTS THAT HE DIDN'T GIVE JOURNALISTS. WHY DID HE GO TO RUSSIA? ONE THING THAT HE DID I'M SURE OF WHAT IS GOING TO RUSSIA WAS DONE AS A RUSSIAN SUPPORTED OPERATION.  >> Tucker: YES, YOU DEMONSTRATED THAT, HE BOARDED A PLANE WITH AN INVALID PASSPORT AND THAT ONLY COULD HAVE HAPPENED WITH THE COMPLICITY OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF THE DOCUMENTS? YOU SAY ONLY THE SMALL PERCENTAGE MADE IT INTO THE HANDS OF JOURNALISTS? WHERE THE REST? WERE ALL OF THEM RELEASED?  >> THAT'S THE TRILLION DOLLAR QUESTION, IN THE MURKY WORLD OF ESPIONAGE, WE DON'T KNOW WHO GETS WHAT DOCUMENTS, WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT TO RUSSIA, CHINA, IF THEY WERE DIVIDED. IF HE THREW THEM INTO THE SEA. THE DAMAGE WAS BASICALLY THE MILITARY, THE PENTAGON HAD TO SPEND A FIVE MONTHS GOING THROUGH 1,500,000 FILES EVERY SORT, EVERY METHOD HAD TO BE CANCELED, A HUGE DISTRICT OF EXERCISE THAT HAPPENED AND WE'VE SUFFERED BECAUSE OF IT.  >> Tucker: I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT FROM WHAT YOU WROTE ON WHY THE NSA WOULD HAVE GIVEN SNOWDEN WHO WAS NOT AN EMPLOYEE, A CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO LEVEL THREE SECRETS, THE HIGHEST LEVEL SECRETS. WHY WOULD THEY HAVE LET HIM HANDLE THOSE OR HAVE ACCESS TO THEM?  >> SNOWDEN SOMEHOW LEARNED THAT ANOTHER CONTRACTOR BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON HAD A CONTRACT TO WORK ON LEVEL THREE WHERE THE SOURCES AND METHODS ARE TAKEN AWAY. HE PURPOSEFULLY SWITCHED JOBS, HE SAID THAT. HE CHANGED JOBS TO GET AT THE LISTS OF COMPUTERS THAT WERE BEING PENETRATED BY THE NSA. IT WASN'T -- THEY DIDN'T ACCIDENTALLY COME BEFORE HIM HE TARGETED AND WENT AFTER THE SOURCES AND METHODS, WHICH ARE THE CROWN JEWELS OF ANY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATIONS INTELLIGENCE BREAD \n",

      "BUFFOON. OR A ZOMBIE. AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR WATCHING US TONIGHT. I AM BILL O'REILLY. PLEASE REMEMBER, THE SPIN STOPS HERE. WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.  >> Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT,\" TONIGHT, A FORMER MEXICAN OFFICIAL SAID THAT IF THE PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES BUILD A WALL, MEXICO OUGHT TO STOP HELPING THE UNITED STATES. EVEN IF THAT LAWS THAT MEANS AG TERRORISTS IN. BUT FIRST, GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN, WE HARDLY KNEW YOU. THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR IS GONE AFTER SPENDING LESS THAN A MONTH IN THE WHITE HOUSE. HE WAS BROUGHT DOWN AFTER HIS CONVERSATION WITH RUSSIA WAS WIRETAPPED BY U.S. INTELLIGENCE. EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BLOCK SUCH WIRETAPPING ON U.S. CITIZENS. EVEN IF HE DID, WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT U.S. INTELLIGENCE THAT IT MAY BE SPYING ON THE ADMINISTRATION? WHEN THE DEMOCRATS WHO DEMANDED THE FIRING OF GENERAL FLYNN, WE ARE JOINED NOW BY HIM. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. AS YOU KNOW, THE LAW REQUIRES A WARRANT IN ORDER TO PROCEED WITH THE WIRETAPPING. THE LAW SPECIFIES THAT IF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN IS CAUGHT UP IN THAT WIRETAPPING, HIS IDENTITY BE PROTECTED AND THE CONTENT OF HIS HEAD OF THE CONVERSATION BE PROTECTED. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN AND SOMEHOW THIS INFORMATION WAS LEAKED TO THE PRESS. ARE YOU FOR THAT?  >> WE ARE NOT FOR THAT, WE WANT THEIR DUE PROCESS AND CIVIL RIGHTS DEFENDED, AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS SOME VERY QUESTIONABLE STUFF GOING ON, THIS WAS IN THE COURSE OF SOME TYPE OF WIRETAPPING AND THEY HAPPENED TO CAP SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE PROCESS BUT AT THE SAME TIM TIME, THE BEST WAY TO ANSWER THIS IS TO HAVE A FULL INVESTIGATION. LET'S GO THROUGH THE PROPER PROCESS SO THAT WAY IF THERE IS ANYTHING QUESTIONABLE, IT GETS FLUSHED OUT. I THINK GENERAL FLYNN WOULD KNOW THAT AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WOULD GO WITH THAT.  >> Tucker: HERE'S WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE CONTENT, BECAUSE IT'S FAR AS I KNOW, THERE ARE NO COPIES OF THE TRANSCRIPT. HAVE YOU SEEN THE TRANSCRIPT?  >> NO, WE HAVE NOT. AN INVESTIGATION AT SOME POINT WOULD BE VALID.  >> Tucker: THAT SOUNDS RIGHT TO ME. WE CAN PROCEED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE IGNORANT OF WHAT WAS SAID. WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT A U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WIRETAPPED AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WHO IS NOT A PART OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENDED AT THE TIME. IS THERE ANYTHING MORE DANGEROUS THAN A U.S. INTELLIGENT AGENCY TO MONITOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ABROAD, TURNING AGAINST A POLITICAL ENEMY AND DESTROYING HIM? WHATEVER YOU THINK OF FLYNN, THAT'S THE MOST DISTURBING PART OF IT, IS IT NOT?  >> I THINK THE MORE DANGEROUS PART IS THE CENTRIFUGE THAT'S GOING ON IN OUR ELECTION, ANY COLLUSION WITH A CAMPAIGN WHETHER THEY KNEW IT OR NOT. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND I AM VERY HAPPY YOU AGREE WITH ME ON THAT. THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN HERE. IF THERE WAS SOME TYPE OF ILLEGAL MANNER THAT THIS WAS OBTAINED OR VIOLATED GENERAL FLYNN'S RIGHTS WHICH SHOULD INVESTIGATE THAT ALSO. SOMETHING WENT WRONG HERE. WE KNOW THAT GENERAL FLYNN LIED TO THE VICE PRESIDENT, MADE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT EMBARRASSED BY THIS. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE OVERSIGHT AS CONGRESS --  >> Tucker: YOU'VE GOT IT BACKWARDS. SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH FLYNN AND PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT, WE DO NOT KNOW THAT HE LIED BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW THE CONTENT OF HIS CONVERSATIONS. BUT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE LEAKING OF HIS IDENTITY IS ILLEGAL. WE KNOW THAT. THAT IS NOT SPECULATION. WE WOULD NEED AN INVESTIGATION TO ASCERTAIN THAT. HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE. BUREAUCRATS WHO NOBODY ELECTED SEEKING TO UNDERMINE THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. IS THAT AGAIN TO THE WAY WE RUN OUR COUNTRY AND THE DEMOCRACY ITSELF? YOU CANNOT HAVE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES GOING ROGUE, CAN YOU?  \n",

THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD HAVE AN INVESTIGATION AND WE SHOULD COVER ALL ASPECTS OF THIS TOO.  >> Tucker: WE AGREE ON THE INVESTIGATION PART. BUT SINCE WE ALREADY KNOW THAT, I AM JUST WONDERING WHY IT IS NOT AT THE VERY CENTER OF YOUR CONCERNS? SINCE THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, YOU WENT TO HARVARD, YOU KNOW THEY EXIST TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT MAKE FOREIGN POLICY. IT'S NOT TO MAKE FOREIGN POLICY MUCH LESS TO EXECUTE IT. IT'S TO GIVE PRESIDENT THE PRET INFORMATION. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO UNDERMINE THAT AND THAT IS A SCARY THING.  >> WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS OCCURRING IN THE BACKGROUND OF IT, WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED AND ASKED THE QUESTIONS. WE KNOW GENERAL FLYNN WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE AMBASSADOR, WE KNOW HE WAS IN VIOLATION WHERE THERE IS ONLY ONE PRESIDENT AT ONE TIME, HE MISSED REPRESENTATIVES CONVERSATIONS WITH PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ACTUALLY WARNED THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THE SITUATIONT OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE STILL OUT THERE.  >> Tucker: I'M NOT HERE TO DEFEND WHAT FLYNN DID, BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT SPLENDID, LIKE YOU. HE DID NOT DISCUSS SANCTIONS OR LIGHTEN THE LOAD ON RUSSIA OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WE DON'T KNOW. BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN THE TRADITION OF ONLY ONE PRESIDENT AT THE TIME? ARE YOU SAYING U.S. CITIZENS DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO CALL OFFICIALS EITHER OF THIS GOVERNMENT OR OTHER GOVERNMENT? I FEEL LIKE I DO AND YOU DO?  >> NOT SO CLOSE TO A CAMPAIGN THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE DIPLOMATIC OUTCOME, THE PRESIDENT AT THAT POINT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA. GENERAL FLYNN WAS POTENTIALLY INVOLVED WITH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND RUSSI RUSSIA. THE PRESIDENT HAD JUST ISSUED SANCTIONS REGARDING VIOLATIONS OF WHAT WE ASSUMED WERE TAMPERING BY RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE AND THE FACT THAT HE CALLED RIGHT AFTERWARD I THINK IT'S QUESTIONABLE. AGAIN, THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD HAVE AN INVESTIGATION.  >> Tucker: HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS SPYING ON AMERICAN CITIZENS AND NOT KEEPING THE INFORMATION SECRET. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE SOME KIND OF CRAZY LEFTISTS BUT YOU ARE ON THE LEFT AND THE LEFT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF STANDING UP FOR SEVERAL LIBERTIES. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY PRIVACY FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SPYING ON YOU, THINGS FALL APART. WHY ARE YOU NOT MORE UPSET ABOUT THAT?  >> WE MAY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON HERE. WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS, IT'S NOT EXACTLY DOING OVERSIGHT RIGHT NOW. FOR ALL WE KNOW AND THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE AN INVESTIGATIO INVESTIGATION, OUR WHISTLEBLOWERS IF YOU WANT TO CALL THEM THAT, MAY HAVE FELT THEY WEREN'T GETTING THE ATTENTION THEY NEEDED AND WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A DANGEROUS SITUATION.  >> Tucker: STOP THERE. YOU ARE SUGGESTING IT COULD BE LEGITIMATE FOR SOMEONE IN THE INTEL AGENCY, SOMEONE OF THE NAME WHISTLEBLOWER, IT COULD BE LEGITIMATE TO TAP INTO HIS PHONE CONVERSATION?  >> NO OVERSIGHT THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL WARNED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THERE IS POTENTIAL LEAKING AND BLACKMAILING SITUATIONS LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS DEMONIC , GENERAL FLYNN --  >> Tucker: I JUST WANT YOU TO SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY YOU SHOULD NOT BREAK THE LAW BY SPYING ON U.S. CITIZENS AND THEN LEAKING ILLEGALLY THE CONTENTS OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO \"THE WASHINGTON POST.\" IF WE CANNOT AGREE THAT'S THE BAD THING, WHAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR CONVERSATION? JUST AGREE THAT THAT IS OUT OF BOUNDS. IT SHOULD BE.  \n",

THE LAW WAS VIOLATED. LET'S JUST SAY THAT. IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT FLYNN IS A GREAT GUY.  >> IT WOULD GIVE US MORE INFORMATION THAN JUST US GOING BACK AND FORTH.  >> Tucker: THAT'S THE ONE PART OF OUR CONVERSATION THAT IS NOT SPECULATION.  >> IF THIS PERSON IS POTENTIALLY COMPROMISED, THEY MIGHT BE BLACKMAILED, AT THE SAME TIME THERE SHOULD BE A POEM MASTICATION ABOUT WHAT OCCURRED.  >> Tucker: CONGRESSMAN, THANKS A LOT. GENERAL FLYNN'S DOWNFALL HAS ALREADY HINDERED TRUMP'S OVERTURES TOWARDS RUSSIA. IT COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD A FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REGIME IN THAT COUNTRY FOR MORE, WE GO TO FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT TRACE GALLAGHER.  >> TUCKER, THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW ACKNOWLEDGING PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS KNOWN FOR WEEKS THAT FORM A NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR MICHAEL FLYNN MISLED THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT HIS CONTACTS WITH RUSSIA. BUT THERE IS NOTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT FLAMES CONVERSATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. CONCERNING U.S. SANCTIONS BUT DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS AND SOME REPUBLICANS ARE CALLING FOR A FULL INQUIRY INTO FOREIGN DISCREPANCIES BUT ALSO RUSSIA. OF RUSSIAN SPIES SHIP IS ALSO PATROLLING OFF THE EAST COAST. OFF THE COAST OF DELAWARE IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS, IT CAN INTERCEPT COMMUNICATIONS, MEASURE U.S. NAVY SONAR AND CARRY SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES. THIS IS THE CLOSEST A RUSSIAN VESSEL HAS GOTTEN TO THE U.S. SENSE TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. THEY HAVE SAID THEY ARE WATCHING IT BUT IT IS NOT A HUGE CONCERN. THEY HAD DEPLOYED TYPICAL BATTALIONS OF GROUND LAUNCH MISSILES AND SEPARATE RUSSIAN -- THE PENTAGON NOW HAS TO DECIDE WHETHER TO HAVE DEFENSE SYSTEM IN EUROPE. IT RUSSIAN FIGHTER JETS CONDUCTED WITH THE U.S. MILITARY CALLS DANGEROUSLY CLOSE FLYBY'S OF A U.S. MILITARY VESSEL IN THE BLACK SEA. THE U.S. SAYS THE JETS WERE AT AN UNUSUALLY LOW ALTITUDE AND UNUSUALLY HIGH SPEED AND THE RUSSIANS IGNORED U.S. CALLS TO HALT THE FLYBYS. FINALLY, THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING THEY BROKE THE LAWS AND FOX AND FRIENDS LAST WEEK, THE OGE IS A RECOMMENDING DISCIPLINARY ACTION, THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS CONWAY HAS BEEN COUNSELED. AGAIN, WHATEVER THAT MEANS. TUCKER.  >> Tucker: TRACE GALLAGHER, THANKS A LOT.

      "Tucker: GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN'S DOWNFALL WAS SWIFT AND PERHAPS TO CLEAN. POLITICALLY OBLITERATED THANKS IN PART TO U.S. INTELLIGENCE MONITORING HIS PRIVATE CONVERSATION. OFFICIAL WASHINGTON WAS TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE PRESIDENT, THAT MAY BE A RHETORICAL QUESTION. BRITT, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. THE FIRST QUESTION IS NOT HOW DID THIS HAPPEN, I JUST WANT TO GET THE OUTCOME AND YOUR ASSESSMENT OF IT. RIGHT. FLYNN THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THIS JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE?  >> THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WERE BENT ON UNDERMINING HIM AND DID SO, LIKE HE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO YOUR FIRST GUEST AND I THINK IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT HE PROBABLY WAS NOT BEST FIT FOR THIS JOB. HE STRONGLY OPINIONATED WITH PASSIONATE VIEWS AND BELIEFS. THAT'S NORMALLY NOT BEEN THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR. WHOSE JOB IT IS PRINCIPALLY TO THE KIND OF ORGANIZE AND CORRELATE THE VIEWPOINTS COMING OUT OF THE AGENCIES FOR THE PRESIDENT TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON. IT'S THEN TO NEUTRALLY PRESENT THOSE VIEWS TO THE PRESIDENT, THAT'S HIS JOB. SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR DOING THAT TOO WELL. DONALD RUMSFELD DID NOT LIKE CONDOLEEZZA RICE BECAUSE SHE TRIED TO WORK EVERYTHING OUT AND GET IT ALL SETTLED BETWEEN DIFFERING PARTIES SO THE PRESIDENT SHOULD MAKE THE CALL. HE THOUGHT THAT SHE SHOULD LET THINGS BE HAD OUTED FROM THE PRESIDENT. OBJECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE, ACCURATE INFORMATION, REPRESENTING ALL VIEWPOINTS OR YOU CAN DECIDE. WHEN YOU PRESENT IN ACCURATE INFORMATION AS HE DID IN THE CASE OF WHAT HE TOLD THE VICE PRESIDENT, WHETHER HE WAS INTENTIONALLY LYING OR NOT, IT'S ALMOST BESIDE THE POINT. YOU HAVE FALLEN DOWN ON THE JOB. HE PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE WITH A MORE NEUTRAL TEMPERAMENT THAN MIKE FLYNN HAD. HE ENJOYS WIDE RESPECT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN HE IS THE RIGHT MAN FOR THIS JOB.  >> Tucker: THAT'S RIGHT, HE MAY HAVE BEEN TEMPERAMENTALLY UNSUITED FOR IT. WHATEVER YOU THINK OF FLYNN SPECIFICALLY, THAT THE AGENCIES CAN UNDO SOMEONE USING DATA GATHERED IN SURVEILLANCE, THAT IS GOT UP AT THE FEAR OF GOD INTO EVERYBODY SERVING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.  >> WHAT PROBABLY LOOKS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED HERE, THEY PICK UP HIS CONVERSATION OF THE U.S. AMBASSADOR. THEY NOW ARE IN POSSESSION WITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITH VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON TWO COUNTS. HAVING IT GET OUT MIGHT COMPROMISE SOURCES AND METHODS AND THE SECOND IS THEY HAVE INFORMATION THAT THEY PROBABLY NOT SHOULD NOT HAVE OR SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL WITH ABOUT THE PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS OF UNITED STATES CITIZEN. THAT INFORMATION IS DOUBLY DISTURBING OF THE KIND OF PROTECTIONS THAT INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE JUST PROVIDING AND IT LEAKED OUT. THAT MAY BE A CRIME. THE QUESTION BECOMES, WAS MIKE FLYNN SINNED AGAINST MORE THAN SENDING?  >> Tucker: CAN YOU GET A HANDLE ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT DOES NOT WANT YOU TO RUN IT? IF YOU HAVE ALL THESE PERMANENT BUREAUCRATS, SOME OF THEM SMART, KNOWLEDGEABLE TALENTED WHO DO NOT WANT YOUR FOREIGN POLICY, AND REJECT YOUR VIEWS CAN YOU EFFECTUALLY USE YOUR VIEWS?  >> VERY GOOD QUESTION, SURE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT IT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I SAW AN ARTICLE, THE DIFFICULTIES THE PRESIDENT MIGHT BE HAVING, STAFFING THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STAFF, MORPHED INTO THIS GREAT BIG AGENCY RELYING ON PEOPLE WHO ARE DRAWN FROM AGENCIES AROUND THE GOVERNMENT, THEY ARE BORROWED TO WORK ON THE NSC. THE STORY SAID THAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ASKED TO BE RETURNED TO THEIR AGENCIES BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO WORK FOR DONALD TRUMP, WELL, WHO DID THEY THINK THEY WOULD BE WORKING FOR WHEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR AGENCIES? THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE MINDSET THAT THESE PEOPLE WILL GO BACK TO THE AGENCIES WHERE THEY COULD MERRILY TRY TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO TORPEDO THE ADMINISTRATION. IF THE EPA AND SOME OF THESE OTHER AGENCIES, YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW, THIS HAS GOT TO BE GOING ON AND THEY ARE RUINING THIS GOVERNMENT AND TAKING IN A NEW DIRECTION WILL BE ABOUT THE HARDEST THING IN THE RECENT ADMINISTRATION HAS TRIED TO DO BECAUSE THE RESISTANCE INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT AND OUTSIDE.  \n",

SOME OF THE MOST HIGHLY HELD GOVERNMENT SECRETS, THIS IS FOR GOOD REASON, SELECTIVELY DISCLOSING DETAILS OF PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS MONITORED BY THE FBI OR NSA GIVES THE PERMANENT STATE THE BUREAUCRACY IN OTHER WORDS THE POWER TO DESTROY REPUTATIONS FROM THE CLOAK OF ANONYMITY. THIS IS WHERE POLICE STATES DO. THERE IS NO SECRET THAT FLYNN HAD A VERY ROCKY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT. HE HAS EVEN SAID THAT HE WAS PREVIOUSLY FORCED OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR DARING TO SPEAK UP ABOUT THE THREAT OF RADICAL ISLAM AND THE NARRATIVE BEING PUT OUT BE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. CONGRESSMAN DEVON NUNEZ IS NOW ASKING THE FBI TO LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHERE ARE THESE LEAKS COMING FROM? AS OUR OWN CATHERINE HERRIDGE REPORTED EARLIER, WHEN FLYNN WAS ASKED IF THE LEAKS WERE TARGETED, COORDINATED AND A POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF THE LAW, HE SAID YES, YES, AND YES. NOBODY IN THE MEDIA IS TELLING YOU THAT. EVER SINCE DONALD TRUMP RAN FOR PRESIDENT, THERE HAS BEEN THIS LIBERAL WITCH HUNT, THEY ARE SALIVATING. A SENSE OF URGENCY. NOBODY CONNECTED TO HIM IS OFF LIMITS. EVEN HIS 10-YEAR-OLD SON, THE MEDIA HAS ATTACKED. HIS DAUGHTER, IVANKA, GOING AFTER A WOMAN. SHE HAS BEEN VICIOUSLY ATTACKED. NOW THEY ARE BOYCOTTS AGAINST HER CLOTHING LINE. THE MEDIA HAS GONE AFTER HIS SON ERIC AND HIS CHARITY WHICH HAS DONATED A LOT OF MONEY TO ST.

NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT AND NEW YORK POST COLUMNIST PAUL SPERRY, I WANT TO GO TO YOU, ELI, AND IT START WITH THIS. MICHAEL FLYNN HAS A PRETTY PRODUCTIVE TITLE HERE. FOR GOOD REASON, SELECTIVELY DISCLOSING DETAILS OF PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS, MONITORED BY THE FBI AND NSA GIVES THE PERMANENT STATE THE POWER TO DESTROY -- THIS IS WHERE POLICE STATES DO. THE PERMANENT STATE, DEFINED THAT.  >> IT IS THE NATIONAL SECURITY BUREAUCRACY, INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE OF THE PENTAGON, ELEMENTS OF THE CAREER MILITARY, CIA, FBI, IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE POSSESSION OF THESE KIND OF INTERCEPTS AND WE TRUST THEM.

THEY ARE GOING TO TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS AND FIND OUT HOW TO FIX THEIR PHONE LINE SO THAT WE CANNOT MONITOR THEM.

BUT THERE'S ALSO A STORY HERE, WITH THE AMOUNT OF LEAKS THAT ARE COMING OUT, PEOPLE THAT ARE ENTRUSTED WITH NATIONAL SECURITY SECRETS, CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ARE LEAKING IT OUT. THAT IS A REAL CONCERN FOR THIS PRESIDENT. WHEN HE WAS TALKING ON THE PHONE WITH A WORLD LEADER, WHEN HE IS MAKING KEY DECISIONS IN PROTECTING THIS COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR OUR GOVERNMENT WHO ARE ENTRUSTED WITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND MATERIAL ARE LEAKING THAT INFORMATION OUT. THAT I DO BELIEVE IT'S A BIG STORY THAT SHOULD BE REPORTED. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHTLY SO VERY, VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST PLAGUING THE CURRENT SITUATION BUT IT GOES BACK TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, BUSH ADMINISTRATION, CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.

WHY WERE THEY LISTENING IN ON FLYNN'S CONVERSATION WITH THE RUSSIANS? THEY BRIEFED THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY DO NOT KNOW IF SOMEONE DID IT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, I THINK THERE WILL BE REAL INVESTIGATIONS BUT THIS IS GOING TO QUICKLY SHIFT FROM FORMS RECORD RESIGNATION TO WHAT KIND OF WHITE HOUSE DOES TRUMP WANT?

THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, THIS IS GOT TO BE TROUBLING TO ANY AMERICAN CITIZEN, THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT IS THE ONE THAT IS LISTENING IN ON THEM AND LEAKING IT.  >> YEAH, IT'S REALLY TROUBLESOME. WE HAVE HAD A GROWING PROBLEM WITH POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INTEL OFFICERS, LET'S BE VERY CLEAR. MOST OF THE INTEL OFFICERS ARE GREAT AMERICANS WORKING VERY HARD. THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE MORE LOYAL TO POLITICAL PARTY. THEY WERE GAINING GROUND DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BUT FRANKLY, THE OBAMA TEAM DID NOT REALLY CRACKDOWN BECAUSE MOST OF THE LEAKS BENEFITED THEM. BUT WITH THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP, THIS HAS BEEN BLOWN WIDE OPEN. WE NOW HAVE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INTEL OFFICERS LEAKING INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S CALLS. LOOK AT WHAT SPUN WHEN HE SPOKE TO THE AUSTRALIAN HEAD OF STATE. IT IS REALLY STRANGE TO HAVE THIS ACTIVITY GOING ON IN OUR INTEL COMMUNITY, THE PRESS WILL PROBABLY NOT CRACKDOWN ON THIS BECAUSE THEY WILL BENEFIT AS WELL. CONGRESS NEEDS TO STEP UP AND THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME MATURE CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO GO IN AND CRACKDOWN AND START FIRING PEOPLE. FROM LEAKING THIS AFFIRMATION ABOUT U.S. OFFICIALS.  >> Sean: I GUESS THE NEXT LOGICAL QUESTION HERE IS OKAY, HE DID NOT TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH TO THE VICE PRESIDENT WHO ASKED HIM. THE WHITE HOUSE SAID NOTHING ILLEGAL WAS DONE HERE, A 1799 ACT THAT THEY WERE REFERRING TO, THE LOGAN ACT, NO ONE HAD EVER BEEN PROSECUTED UNDER THAT. NOTHING CRIMINAL, AND THEN THEY SPEND A COUPLE WEEKS FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT AND IT RESULTS IN THE ISSUE OF TRUST. BUT BASED ON LEAKED INFORMATION. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE?  >> OBVIOUSLY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS DEALING WITH A LOT OF BUREAUCRATS, PEOPLE THAT ARE CLEARLY LEAKING AND NOT ONLY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES BUT ALSO SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT MIKE FLYNN WITH AN EFFORT TO TRY TO DISCREDIT HIM AND TO TRY TO GET HIM KICKED OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION.

A SHOCKING SITUATION. CAUTION, YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE \"NO SPIN ZONE.\" SB 16 BEGINS RIGHT NOW. ♪  >> Bill: HI, I AM BILL O'REILLY. THANKS FOR WATCHING US TONIGHT. MASS HYSTERIA OVER GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN. THAT IS A SUBJECT OF THIS EVENING'S \"TALKING POINTS\" MEMO. AS WE REPORTED LAST NIGHT, THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR HAS RESIGNED BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT LOST CONFIDENCE IN HIM. THE STORY IS A BIT COMPLICATED BUT IT BOILS DOWN TO THIS. FLYNN HAD CONTACT WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IN LATE DECEMBER, WHILE BARACK OBAMA WAS STILL PRESIDENT. ACCORDING TO LEAKS FROM THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, FLYNN DISCUSSED MR. OBAMA'S A SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA. THEN, GENERAL FLYNN DENIED THAT TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. THE FBI ALSO INTERVIEWED GENERAL FLYNN AND IF YOU LIED TO THEM CAN BETTER BE A CRIME. HOWEVER, THAT IS A BIG IF. IT IS NOT A CRIME FOR MR. FLYNN TO INFORMALLY TALK WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR BEFORE DONALD TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. BUT IT IS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE IF POLICY WAS DISCUSSED. SO, AT THIS POINT, FLYNN IS OUT AND IT LOOKS LIKE RETIRED VICE ADMIRAL BURL ROBERT HARWARD WILL TAKE HIS PLACE. HE IS 60 YEARS OLD, EXTENSIVE MILITARY EXPERIENCE, SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN. IT LOOKS LIKE A SOLID CHOICE BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. BY THE WAY, THE FBI IS STILL INVESTIGATING THE WHOLE RUSSIAN SITUATION, BUT THAT IS ALL WE KNOW AT THIS POINT. HOWEVER, LACK OF FACTS DOESN'T STOP THE ANTI-TRUMP PRESS IT FROM WHIPPING UP HYSTERIA. THERE ARE TWO THINGS IN PLAY. FIRST, THE TRUMP HATERS ARE FERVENTLY HOPING THEY CAN LINK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO THE RUSSIAN HACKERS, WHO DISRUPTED THE CONTENT CAMPAIGN. THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL FOR THE HATERS. IF THEY CANNOT ACHIEVE THAT, THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE GENERAL FLYNN TELL THE WORLD BUT DONALD TRUMP ORDERED HIM TO CALL THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. SO, THAT IS THE MEDIA GAME PLAN. YESTERDAY, THE BOMBAST ON OUR CABLE COMPETITION WAS ACTUALLY HUMOROUS. \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" COLUMNIST THOMAS FRIEDMAN COMPARED THE RUSSIAN HACKING TO WAR.  >> WE HAVE NEVER TAKEN SERIOUSLY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING RUSSIA HACKED OUR ELECTION. THAT WAS A 9/11 SCALE EVENT. THEY ATTACKED THE CORE OF OUR VERY DEMOCRACY. THAT WAS A PEARL HARBOR SCALE EVENT.  >> Bill: HERE IS HOW CRAZY THAT STATEMENT IS. SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP DECLARED WAR ON RUSSIA, AS WE DID AFTER PEARL HARBOR. WOULD THOMAS FRIEDMAN SUPPORT THAT? OF COURSE NOT. SO, THIS IS JUST MADNESS. HOWEVER, THE ANTI-TRUMP MEDIA LOVES THIS KIND OF STUFF. I WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE. IT HAS TO DO WITH SPECULATION.  \n",

HERE IS THE REMEDY, IF I MAY REALLY PUT SOMETHING THAT IS CONCRETE OUT THERE. THAT IS FOR THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE TO GET THE COUNCIL AND THE WHITE HOUSE TO LOOK AT THIS. THE PRESIDENT HAS AUTHORITY TO RELEASE ANYTHING, EVEN MATERIAL THAT IS CLASSIFIED, AND PUT OUT A REPORT AND SAY, THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. THIS IS WHAT WENT ON. BECAUSE THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO TAKE MONTHS. THE FBI, GOD KNOWS HOW LONG THAT IS GOING TO TAKE. WHEN DO HAVE CREATED THE ENVIRONMENT OF SUSPICION AND ANXIETY.  >> Bill: I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I WANT TO --  >> WHY DON'T THEY DO THIS?  >> Bill: THERE ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF EVERY ACTION, AS YOU KNOW. IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE AN ENEMY OUT OF GENERAL FLYNN, WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T WANT TO DO, YOU HANG HIM. ALL RIGHT? YOU MAKE AN ENEMY OUT OF HIM.  >> HE HAS FIRED HIM. THAT IS A PRETTY SERIOUS MATTER. INDEED, IT IS.  >> Bill: I AM AGREEING YOU. HE SAID NICE THINGS ABOUT HIM TODAY. HE DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT TO ALIENATE HIM OR MAKE HIM WHAT THEY CALL A SCAPEGOAT. THEN, FLYNN WOULD HAVE TO DEFEND HIMSELF, THEN, FLYNN CAN COME BACK AND SAY SO AND SO TOLD ME TO DO THIS. IF HE COMES -- IT BECOMES A REAL MESS. I'M NOT SAYING THEY SHOULDN'T.  >> YOU DON'T THINK IT'S A MESS NOW?  >> Bill: LAST WORD.  >> OKAY, THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL COULD CONDUCT AN INQUIRY, LOOK AT ALL THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS, TALK TO GENERAL FLYNN AND PUT IT OUT OR HAVE SOME REPORTERS WHO ARE NEUTRAL IN ALL OF THIS IN TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAY, HERE ARE THE DOCUMENTS, HERE ARE A PEOPLE ARE SAYING COME AND PUT IT OUT.

A VERY, VERY UNFAIR.  >> TRUMP ALSO WENT AFTER \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" FOR SAYING THAT TRUMP ASSOCIATES HAD CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIAN INTEL AGENTS. DURING HIS NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER, THE PRESIDENT SAID HE HAS NOT COMMITTED TO THE CREATION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE. THE TWO STATE SOLUTION HAS LONG BEEN A PILLAR OF THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS BUT MR. TRUMP SAYS HE CAN LIVE WITH A ONE STATE OR TWO STATE SOLUTION AND THE PRESIDENT APPEARED TO STARTLE NETANYAHU WHEN HE DROPPED A BIT OF A BOMBSHELL, TO STOP CONSTRUCTION OF SETTLEMENTS. ANDREW POZNER HAS WITHDRAWN HIS NOMINATION, BECAUSE OF HIS STANCE ON LABOR ISSUES AND THE FACT THAT HE EMPLOYED AN UNDOCUMENTED HOUSEKEEPER.

ON JANUARY 15TH, HE WAS ASKED THE QUESTION, WHETHER A CAMPAIGN AIDE HAD COMMUNICATION WITH THE KREMLIN. AND HE SAID NO. AGAIN, THIS IS AFTER JANUARY 6TH WHEN HE WAS A PART OF BRIEFING WHERE HE SAID THE EXACT OPPOSITE.  >> Ed: THE STORY IN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" TODAY SAID, THE OFFICIALS INTERVIEWED IN RECENT WEEKS SAID THAT SO FAR, THEY HAD SEEN NO EVIDENCE, NO EVIDENCE OF SUCH COOPERATION.

NOT THAT THEY HAD HELPED TRUMP. THEN IT WAS IT THAT HE HELPED TRUMP BUT THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE KREMLIN AND THE TOP EIGHT AIDE.

HOW CORRUPT THAT IS.  >> LOOK, I THINK MOST PEOPLE AT CNN ARE THOROUGHLY DECENT JOURNALIST. I RESPECT THEIR INTEGRITY. WHEN I SAW THAT BEHAVIOR, DELIBERATELY SHOWING QUESTIONS TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. I WAS SHOCKED BY THAT. \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAMPAIGN, 11 DIFFERENT PIECES -- ALL PIECES ON DONALD TRUMP WERE NEGATIVE.

GO THROUGH FROM A LEGAL ASPECT OF THE INTELLIGENCE LEAKS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE. HOW IT WOULD VIOLATE THE ESPIONAGE ACT, 18 U.S. CODE 798 WHICH WE WILL GET INTO IN MORE DETAIL. TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THESE INTELLIGENCE LEAKS WHICH WE KNOW ARE ILLEGAL AND IS AT THE BIGGER STORY?  >> IT IS NOW CLEAR FROM PUBLISHED INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE WHO HAD AUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SIGNALED INTELLIGENCE UNDER THE ESPIONAGE ACT, CRYPTOGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE, TELEPHONE INTERCEPTS, WIRETAPS, HAVE GIVEN THAT INFORMATION IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW TO NEWS ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER PARTIES WHO ARE NOT AUTHORIZEDO RECEIVE THEM. THOSE DISCLOSURES BY PEOPLE WHO GOT THE INFORMATION LAWFULLY ARE CRIMES. THEY ARE FELONIES, UNDER THE ESPIONAGE ACT. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD IMMEDIATELY IMPANEL A GRAND JURY AND START DEFEATING THE LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LAWFUL ACCESS TO THESE TELEPHONE INTERCEPTS. THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IS QUITE SMALL AND THEY CAN START ISSUING SUBPOENAS TO THOSE PEOPLE, HAVE THEM INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI, PUT THEM IN THE GRAND JURY AND I CAN ASSURE YOU, WITH THE REASONABLE PROSECUTOR -- YOU CAN FIND OUT WHO DISCLOSED THIS INFORMATION BY LOOKING AT THEIR TELEPHONE RECORDS, THEIR EMAILS, AND EVERYTHING ELSE RELATED TO HOW THEY COMMUNICATE WITH THIRD PARTIES.  >> Sean: YOU HAVE NO DOUBT, FELONIES WERE COMMITTED. NO DOUBT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY OR A FEW MEMBERS WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAVE DONE THIS ON PURPOSE, ON NUMEROUS TIMES, CONVERSATIONS WITH MEXICO, AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. YOU THINK IT WILL BE FAIRLY EASY TO DISCOVER WHO IT WAS?  >> YES, WITH THE USE OF A GRAND JURY WHICH WAS NOT USED IN THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL SERVICE CASE. YOU CAN FIND OUT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS YOU NEED TO DO ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS A COUP D'ÉTAT. THIS IS DESIGNED NOT TO JUST DELEGITIMIZE PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT TO CREATE THE ATMOSPHERIC FOREIGN IMPEACHMENT AND FOR OTHER LEGAL STRATAGEMS TO DESTROY HIS PRESIDENCY. IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THINKS ABOUT THIS FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES, THERE WILL BE A GRAND JURY AT WORK, SURE AS THE SUN WILL RISE TOMORROW.  \n",

      "GOOD EVENING, LIVE FROM AMERICA'S NEWSROOM HEADQUARTERS, LABOR TROUBLES FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. EARLIER TODAY, ANDREW PUZDER WITHDREW AS NOMINEE FOR LABOR SECRETARY. THIS CAME ONE DAY BEFORE HIS SCHEDULED CONFIRMATION HEARING. DEMOCRATS AND EVEN SOME REPUBLICANS HAD RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HIS FAILURE TO PAY TAXES FOR FIVE YEARS ON A FORMER HOUSEKEEPER WHO WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO WORK HERE IN THE U.S. NO WORD YET ON THE NEW POSSIBLE NOMINEE. ANOTHER SETBACK FOR MICHAEL FLYNN, JUST TWO DAYS AFTER RESIGNING DUE TO REPORTS OF CONTACTS WITH THE RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT, THE DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY HAS A SUSPENDED HIS ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION PENDING A REVIEW. SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE CALLING FOR AN INDEPENDENT SPECIAL COUNSEL TO LOOK AT OTHER POSSIBLE TIES. NOW, BACK TO \"HANNITY\" .\"  >> MICHAEL FLYNN, GENERAL FLYNN AS A WONDERFUL MAN. HE'S BEEN TREATED VERY, VERY UNFAIRLY BY THE MEDIA. THE FAKE MEDIA IN MANY CASES. I THINK IT IS REALLY A SAD THING THAT HE WAS TREATED SO BADLY. IN ADDITION TO THAT, FROM INTELLIGENCE PAPERS ARE BEING LEAKED, THINGS ARE BEING LEAKED. IT'S CRIMINAL ACTION, AND IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME, BEFORE ME. BUT NOW IT IS REALLY GOING ON. PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO COVER UP FOR A TERRIBLE LOSS THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAD UNDER HILLARY CLINTON. I THINK IT IS VERY, VERY UNFAIR WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO GENERAL FLYNN, THE WAY HE WAS TREATED AND THAT THE DOCUMENTS AND PAPERS THAT WERE ILLEGALLY -- I STRESS THAT -- ILLEGALLY LEAKED. VERY, VERY UNFAIR.  >> Sean: THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP EARLIER TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. TALKING ABOUT MIKE FLYNN'S RESIGNATION AND THE LEAKS COMING FROM INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. PRIOR TO THE PRESS CONFERENCE, TRUMP TWEETED... THE REAL SCANDAL HERE IS THE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, ILLEGALLY GIVEN OUT BY INTELLIGENCE, LIKE CANDY. VERY UN-AMERICAN. JOINING US NOW, DEVIN NUNES IS WITH US. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, ISN'T IT A CRIME IN FACT TO LEAK THIS INFORMATION? ISN'T IT IN VIOLATION OF THE ESPIONAGE ACT?  >> THERE COULD HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE CRIMES HERE COMMITTED TO, SEAN, BUT FOR SURE. LEAKING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS PUNISHABLE BY LAW. IT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO BY THE APPROPRIATE AGENCIES, OUR COMMITTEE IS GOING TO BE REQUESTED, TO TRY TO BRING THESE PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE AND HOLD THEM UNDER THE LAW.  >> Sean: I WANT TO GO BACK, TO THIS PIECE. IN THE WANING DAYS OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION EXPANDED THE POWER OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY TO SHARE GLOBALLY INTERCEPTED PERSONNEL COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S 16 OTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES BEFORE APPLYING PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. DOES THAT MEAN THE LIST OF POTENTIAL LEAKERS IS THAT MUCH BIGGER OR NOT?  >> IF THAT IS THE CASE, WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED OF THAT AT THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT LEAKED, THE TRANSCRIPTS THAT LEAKED ON GENERAL FLYNN, THE TRANSCRIPTS THAT DONALD TRUMP TALKING TO THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT, THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER, THOSE ALSO LEAKED. THIS IS A STATE HERE THAT IS FALLING APART AND IT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANYONE WITHIN GOVERNMENT TO BE DOING THIS. I THINK MOST OF THIS IS PROBABLY FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE OLD ADMINISTRATION. BUT THERE STILL COULD BE SOME PEOPLE THAT HAVE BURROWED IN AND ARE PROVIDING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA.  >> Sean: IS CLEARLY A VIOLATION OF LAW, IS IT NOT? IS THIS NOT THE TYPE OF THING THAT IF YOU HAVE A INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE, ILLEGALLY INTERCEPTING PHONE CALLS OF AMERICANS, THAT'S ILLEGAL. IF, IN FACT, THEY WANTED TO GET THE INTEL OR HACK INTO THE PHONE OF GENERAL FLYNN, WOULDN'T THEY HAVE TO GET A COURT SUBPOENA TO DO SO?  \n",

      "Russia Document # 151. 14: 32.0%, 8: 20.0%\n",
      ">> THAT IS CORRECT. I AM NOT AWARE THAT THEY DID THAT. MY GUESS IS THAT THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES DID NOT DO THIS. WHAT I AM ASSUMING IS IS THIS WAS PICKED UP AS THEY WERE TRACKING SOMEONE ELSE. IF THAT IS THE CASE, THAT WOULD HAVE HAD TO GO UP TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO GET APPROVAL TO UNMASK WHO THAT PERSON IS. IN THIS CASE, IT WAS GENERAL FLYNN. THEN IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT THESE LEAKS, SEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE THESE ORIGINAL LEAKS THAT WERE LEAKED TO THE MEDIA HAPPENED IN THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY. THAT WOULD MEAN IT WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM THE ADMINISTRATION.  >> Sean: WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CONVENE A GRAND JURY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS?  >> THE FIRST THING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THE FBI NEEDS TO DO A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THIS AND TRYING TRACK DOWN THESE LEAKERS.  >> Sean: JOINING US NOW WITH MORE REACTION IS STEVE KING, HE SAID WHAT HAPPENED TO MIKE FLYNN WAS A POLITICAL ASSASSINATION. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN.  >> INCORPORATED YOU FOR HAVING ME ON. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS STRATEGIC, IT WAS UNFOLDED AND KIND OF SYNCHRONIZED. THAT THE INTEL THAT WAS GATHERED, PERHAPS WITHIN THE FBI, SOMEONE WITHIN THE FBI. OR OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY AND STRATEGICALLY LEAKED TO DO MAXIMUM DAMAGE TO MIKE FLYNN. WE KNOW THE LONG KNIVES HAD COME OUT FOR HIM, THIS LOOKS LIKE A STRATEGIC PLAN. I'M NOT EXCUSING THE PART THAT WAS MISCOMMUNICATIONS AND DISHONESTY BUT THAT WAS BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND MIKE FLYNN. I WAS SPECIFICALLY SAYING THAT THE FEDERAL STATUTE THAT IS VIOLATED IS 18 USC 798, MAKES IT CLEAR THAT IT IS A FELONY, TEN YEARS AND OF PENITENTIARY FOR COMMUNICATING IN A CLASSIFIED INFORMATION THAT IS RETRIEVED THROUGH OUR SIGNAL INTELLIGENCE COMMUNICATIONS.  >> Sean: I HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME, THE CODE, WHOEVER KNOWINGLY AND WILLFULLY COMMUNICATES, TRANSMITS OR OTHERWISE MAKES AVAILABLE TO AN UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS OR USES IN ANY MANNER OR FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- THAT'S WHAT THE CODE SAYS. TO HAVE ANY DOUBT CRIMES WERE COMMITTED HERE?  >> NO DOUBT. I AGREE WITH DEVIN NUNES, IF IT WAS OBTAINED THROUGH A WARRANT, AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT IT THAT INFORMATION COULD COME OUT, NOW WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS EITHER EMBEDDED WITHIN THE FBI OR ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT IT WILLFULLY LEAKED THIS TO \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" AND \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" .\" NOW WE HAVE A NATION OF LEFTISTS THAT ARE HYPERVENTILATING OVER ACTUALLY NOW ARE RUMORS. WE DO NOT HAVE THE TRANSCRIPTS OF THOSE TELEPHONE CALLS OR A SINGLE PHRASE, WE HAVE THESE LONG STORIES THAT ARE COMING OUT AND NOW THE DEMOCRATS HAVE CREATED AN ENTIRE NARRATIVE ABOUT THIS. THEY'RE EITHER TRYING TO GET THE WHOLE NATION WRAPPED UP IN THIS BUT THEY WERE NEVER MARRIED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S REAL-TIME HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, WHILE SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.  >> Sean: WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US. COMING UP TONIGHT, DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA WEIGHS IN ON U.S. RUSSIAN RELATIONS AND ALSO, LATER TONIGHT...  >> UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP, I BELIEVE WE CAN REVERSE THE RADICAL TIDE OF RADICAL ISLAM.  >> Sean: HISTORY IN THE MAKING MAKING, ARI FLEISCHER AND STEVE HILTON WILL JOIN US. KEVIN McCARTHY, ALL ON THIS BUSY NEWSNIGHT OF \"HANNITY\" .\" y. y. \n",

      ">> Bill: NOW, IT SHOULD BE NOTED PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THE SAME THING WHEN HE TOOK OVER FOR PRESIDENT BUSH THE YOUNGER. THE TONE OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE WAS COMBATIVE, YET, THE PRESIDENT WAS IN COMMAND COME I DIDN'T TAKE ANY GOLF, AND ANSWERED MOST OF THE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY. HERE IS MY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR MICHAEL FLYNN WAS FIRED.  >> President Trump: THE THING IS, HE DIDN'T TELL OUR VICE PRESIDENT PROPERLY, THEN, HE SAID HE DIDN'T REMEMBER, SO, EITHER WAY, IT WASN'T VERY SATISFACTORY TO ME.D I HAVE SOMK WILL BE OUTSTANDING FOR THE POSITION.  >> Bill: LOOKING FORWARD, THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL HAVE A NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER ON REFUGEES BY NEXT WEEK. HE WILL HAVE A REVISION OF OBAMACARE READY BY MARCH. AND HE REITERATED HE DOESN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING HE DOES WILL BE COVERED FAIRLY BY ANY AND THE PRESS. JOINING US NOW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, JOHN ROBERTS, WHO QUESTION THE PRESIDENT TODAY. SO, HE DID NOT ANSWER YOU WHEN YOU ASK HIM IF HE HAD READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF GENERAL FLYNN'S CONVERSATION WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. WERE YOU ABLE TO GET US ANY MORE INFORMATION ON THAT, JOHN?  >> BILL, HE DID NOT ANSWER ME DIRECTLY, ONLY TO SAY THAT FROM WHAT HE SAW AND WHAT HE HEARD, HE BELIEVED THAT GENERAL PLAN HAD NOT ACTED IMPROPERLY. I DID A LITTLE BIT OF DIGGING A MESS AFTERNOON. I DISCOVER THE PRESIDENT WAS IN FACT -- YOU WANT HER THIS ANYWHERE ELSE, BILL, EXCLUSIVE INFORMATION FOR YOU -- THE PRESIDENT WAS IN FACT FULLY BRIEFED ON THE CONTENT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN HAD WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR, SERGEY KINSLEY AT, BY PEOPLE WHO WOULD KNOW WHAT THE CONTENT OF THE PHONE CONVERSATIONS WAS, AND THAT UNDER REPEATED QUESTIONING DURING AN INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE, GENERAL FLYNN, I AM TOLD, HAD A FULL RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT GENERAL FLYNN HAD INITIALLY SAID THAT HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT SANCTIONS, HE SAID, MAYBE I DON'T REMEMBER, NOT 100% SURE. HE IS 100% SURE AND HE TOLD THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE AND THE PEOPLE WHO TALK TO HIM IN THOSE INTERVIEWS AT THE COUNSEL'S OFFICE WAS CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION, BUT HE TALKED TO THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR ABOUT.  >> Bill: NOW, I'M ASSUMING THAT THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, WHAT IS HIS NAME AGAIN?  >> DONALD MCGAHN.  >> Bill: I'M ASSUMING THAT HE IS THE ONE THAT BRIEFED DONALD TRUMP ABOUT IT. THERE IS A TRANSCRIPT AVAILABLE. I'M JUST WONDERING WHY THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T READ IT HIMSELF, PERHAPS WE WILL LEARN THAT NEXT WEEK. BE THAT AS IT MAY, I THOUGHT THAT WHEN HE STARTED OFF ON THE LEAKERS, THAT THIS WAS A WAY TO OBSCURE IF GENERAL FLYNN HAD REALLY DONE ANY DAMAGE TO THIS COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, YOU JUST DEFLECT INTO A DIFFERENT AREA. DID YOU SEE IT THAT WAY?  >> CERTAINLY COME MIGHT LET ME GO BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID. I WILL REPEAT IT. THE PRESIDENT WAS FULLY BRIEFED ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS BY PEOPLE WHO WOULD KNOW WHAT WAS SAID IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL. NOW, BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, BILL. OBVIOUSLY, A LOT FOR THE PRESIDENT DID TODAY AND THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WAS DEFLECT. WHEN YOU GO OFF ON THE MEDIA ABOUT NEGATIVE STORIES AND FAKE NEWS, YOU ARE DEFLECTING FROM WHAT THE ISSUES OF THE DAY ARE. YOU ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE. THE SAME THING WITH THE LEAKS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR DID, WHO HE TALKED TO KIM WHAT HE SAID IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THIS IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE, WHO LEAKED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.  >> Bill: IS A PRETTY SERIOUS SUBJECT.  >> IT IS A SERIOUS SUBJECT WHICH IS WHY THE PRESIDENT, WHO HAS REACHED OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO LAUNCH A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO WHO WAS BEHIND THIS. OTHER PRESIDENTS HAVE LODGED INVESTIGATIONS INTO LEAKS AND THEY HAVE REALLY GONE NOWHERE. I THINK SCOOTER LIBBY IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN RECENT MEMORY, AT LEAST, --  >> Bill: DICK CHENEY'S CHIEF OF STAFF.  >> EXACTLY. NOT BEING TRUTHFUL IN AN INTERVIEW.  >> Bill: DO YOU KNOW WHO TAPED FLYNN? WHO TAPED HIM?  >> IT WOULD BE THE NSA.  >> Bill: OKAY.  >> THEY WENT TO A FISA COURT AND I GET A WARRANT FOR A WIRETAP AND IT IS THE NSA THAT TYPICALLY --  \n",

WE DON'T KNOW THAT.  >> THEY WOULDN'T TELL HIM.  >> Bill: OKAY. THIS IS FASCINATING. SO, FLYNN MAKES THE CALL, HE SHOULD KNOW, BEING A SOPHISTICATED GUY, THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE TAPING IT, FOR DAMN SURE, AND THAT THE NSA IS PROBABLY TAPING IT BECAUSE IT IS A CALL TO THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. BUT THEY DON'T TELL HIM, HEY, WE ARE TAPING THIS. SO, THAT, THEN, IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHARGERS FLOATING AROUND, THAT FLYNN LIED TO THE FBI ABOUT WHAT HE SAID, THAT IS THE LATEST. WE WILL GET ONTO THIS ON THE PROGRAM A LITTLE BIT LATER. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, DOESN'T STACK UP IF FLYNN KNEW HE WAS BEING TAPED. WHY WOULD HE LIE TO THE FBI ABOUT A? THAT IS A CRIME.  >> YOU WOULD THINK THAT A PERSON ABOUT THE SOPHISTICATED KNOWLEDGE OF ELECTRONIC INTERCEPTS, AS HE DID AND WOULD BECAUSE HE WAS THE HEAD OF THE DIA, WOULD NOT LIE TO THE FBI. BUT THE CONTENTS OF THE INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION, HE HAD A GOOD INSURANCE KNOWING IT WAS BEING TAPED. MAYBE THERE IS, I DON'T KNOW, I AM GIVING SOMEBODY THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, MAYBE THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT INITIALLY HE DIDN'T RECALL WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT.  >> Bill: ALL OF THAT WILL COME OUT AND WE WILL REPORT IT HONESTLY, UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHERS. I WILL HOLD JOHN OVER FOR ANOTHER MINUTE. I WILL DEBATE BERNIE GOLDBERG DOWN THE LINE HERE ON WHETHER THE PRESIDENT WAS UNHINGED IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE. DID YOU SEE HIM AS UNHINGED AT ALL?  >> NOT AT ALL. IN FACT, HE MADE THAT POINT TO SAY, PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE IS RANTING AND RAVING, HE IS NOT, HE IS HAVING FUN. I THOUGHT AND I TALKED TO MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THIS, THEY HAVE AGREED WITH ME, THE PRESIDENT HAS A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN THAT SORT OF SETTING NOW THAT HE NEVER DID BEFORE. I THINK IT IS BY VIRTUE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF GOING THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN, GOING THROUGH THE ELECTION, THE TRANSITION FROM AN OUTCOME OF BEING PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES BUT HE HAS DEVELOPED THE CONFIDENCE THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE. HE STOOD UP THERE FOR AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES AND KNOCKED ON A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WERE THROWN AGAINST HIM. I THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB.  >> Bill: HE IS THE BACKS OF A SPOKESMAN FOR HIM. THE CNN GUYS, ARE THEY MAD, OR ARE THEY SAYING THIS IS BIGGER RATINGS FOR US? ARE THEY MAD?  >> I TALKED TO JIM ACOSTA AND HE WAS QUITE HAPPY THAT HE GOT THE MIGHT OF TIME HE DID WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE HAD A VERY SPIRITED BACK AND FORTH. I THINK THEY BOTH MADE THEIR POINTS AND CAME OUT OF IT OKAY.  >> Bill: ALL RIGHT, WE APPRECIATE YOUR GOOD WORK. NEXT ON THE RUNDOWN OF THE TALKING POINTS MEMO, ON HOW PEOPLE IN THE PRESS AS WELL AS PEOPLE WORKING IN THE GOVERNMENT ARE TRYING TO SABOTAGE TRUMP. BERNIE GOLDBERG, MOMENTS AWAY. . \n",

      "Bill: \"IMPACT SEGMENT\" TONIGHT, THE SWAMP FIGHTS BACK. THE SUBJECT OF THIS EVENING'S \"TALKING POINTS\" MEMO. DONALD TRUMP, LARGELY ELECTED PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE PROMISED TO REFORM WASHINGTON. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE FED UP WITH INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST POLITICIANS WERE KNOCKING UP FOR THEM PLAYED MR. TRUMP PORTRAYED THE NATION'S CAPITAL AS A SWAMP.  >> President Trump: I WANT THE ENTIRE CORRUPT WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT TO HEAR THE WORDS OF WE ALL ARE ABOUT TO SAY. WHEN WE WIN TOMORROW, WE ARE GOING TO DRAIN THE SWAMP!  >> Bill: BUT FOR EVERY ACTION, THERE IS A REACTION AND A LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IS NOW HITTING PRESIDENT TRUMP. THAT IS BECAUSE THE SWAMP IS INHABITED BY MANY DIFFERENT CREATURES, SOME OF WHOM WANT TO DESTROY THE PRESIDENT. RIGHT NOW, THE NATIONAL MEDIA DESPISES MR. TRUMP, AS WE POINTED OUT, AND BACKED UP WITH FACTS. ALSO, SOME FOLKS WORKING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WANT TO DAMAGE A PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE SEEING THE LEAKS FROM INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND OTHER FEDERAL BUREAUCRACIES. NOW, ALL PRESIDENTS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS. BUT IN THIS POLITICAL CLIMATE, THE PRESS GLEEFULLY, GLEEFULLY ACCEPTS INFORMATION FROM ANONYMOUS SOURCES AND SPENDS A NEGATIVE AGAINST TRUMP. AS WE TALKED ABOUT LAST NIGHT, THE PUBLIC AND PRESS DOESN'T KNOW WHAT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN SAID TO THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. WE WILL KNOW BUT WE DON'T NOW. ALSO, THERE ARE A SEMITRUTH TO ALLEGATIONS THAT PEOPLE WORKING ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAD MEANINGFUL CONTACT WITH THE RUSSIA, BUT WE DON'T KNOW. YET, THE PRESS IS RUNNING WILD WITH THE STORIES AND THE TRUMP HATERS ARE RELISHING IN THE WITCH HUNTS.  >> IF THEY WERE DIALOGUES AND NEGOTIATED WITH THE RUSSIANS, WITH THE RUSSIANS, WHICH IS CLEARLY AGAINST THE LAW, AND CLEARLY AN ACT THAT CANNOT BE, IF THE PRESIDENT KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND IT DID NOT STOP IT, OR IN SOME WAY AUTHORIZE IT, THAT BE IMPEACHABLE.  >> Bill: [LAUGHS] NOT AGAINST THE LAW FOR ANYONE TO TALK WITH ANY RUSSIANS. GENERAL FLYNN HAD NO POWER BEING A PRIVATE CITIZEN, WHEN THE CALL WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE PLACE. IN ORDER FOR HIM TO COMMIT A CRIME, HE WOULD FIRE TO FORMALLY ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONS RUSSIAN POLICY. AL SHARPTON IS FULL OF IT, AS ALWAYS. THERE IS A REPORT TODAY THAT SAYS GENERAL FLYNN MAY HAVE LIED TO THE FBI. WE MENTIONED THAT. IF IT IS TRUE, THAT IS A CRIME. SO, WE'LL SEE. AS \"TALKING POINTS\" REPORTED LAST NIGHT, THERE ARE TWO GOALS HERE. FIRST, TO LEAK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO THE RUSSIAN HACKERS, WHO DISRUPTED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. THE SECOND, TO TRY TO PROVE THAT PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP WAS UNDERMINING PRESIDENT OBAMA AND RUSSIAN POLICY BACK IN DECEMBER. THAT IS WHAT THE MEDIA GOAL IS, THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT. ALSO, AS WE SAID LAST NIGHT, IF THERE IS TRUTH TO THOSE ALLEGATIONS, THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY, WHEN THE FACTS ARE PRESENTED. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP FIRST MENTION DRAINING THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON, I DON'T BELIEVE HE UNDERSTOOD HOW EXTENSIVE THE PROBLEM REALLY IS. FOR EIGHT YEARS OF PRESIDENTS OBAMA, THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WORKING IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO LIKED THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND WHO DESPISED MR. TRUMP. ELIMINATING ALL OF THEM, STOPPING THE LEAKS, PRETTY MUCH BE IMPOSSIBLE. ALSO DON'T TRYING TO GET FAIRNESS OUT OF THE ANTI-TRUMP , AS WELL. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ITS HANDS FULL. THAT IS \"THE MEMO.\" NOW, REACTION. NOW, JOINING US FROM STANFORD CONNECTICUT, ARI FLEISCHER, WHO WORKED WITH PRESIDENT BUSH THE YOUNGER. WHAT DO YOU THINK?  >> THEY ARE CUT FROM DIFFERENT CLOTHS, BILL. GEORGE W. BUSH WAS A MUCH MORE GRACIOUS INSIDER ESTABLISHMENT PERSON. DONALD TRUMP WAS THE OPPOSITE. DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW WHO HAS THE MOXIE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THE PRESS LIKE THIS. HE IS DOING IN PUBLIC WHAT I OF REPUBLICANS I KNOW TALK ABOUT IN PRIVATE PRAYER TRUMP IS ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE SMACKS TO THE PRE THINKS THEY DESERVE.  >> Bill: THEY ARE GOING TO HIT BACK, THOUGH.

LET'S GO CONVINCE THE ELECTORATES TO VOTE, THE ONLY SHRED THEY HOLD ONTO IS THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW, IT COULD HAVE BEEN RIGGED, THE RUSSIANS COULD HAVE PLAYED AN ILLEGITIMATE ROLE.  >> Sean: NO EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIANS IMPACTED THE ELECTION IN ANY WAY.
