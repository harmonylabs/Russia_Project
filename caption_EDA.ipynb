HERE IS WHAT SPEAKER PELOSI SAID. IN PART SHE WROTE IT IS WRONG FOR THE PRESIDENT AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO FAN THE FLAMES TO MAKE ANYONE LESS SAFE. THE MEMORY OF 9/11 IS SACRED GROUND AND ANY DISCUSSION OF IT MUST BE DONE YOU WITH REVERENCE. THE PRESIDENT SHOULDN'T USE THE PAINFUL IMAGES OF 9/11 FOR A POLITICAL ATTACK. AND KEEP IT IN MIND THIS IS JUST AFTER A MAN WAS CHARGED WITH MAKING DEATH THREATS AGAINST OMAR. SO DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY PROTECTIVE OF HER. AS YOU MENTIONED, 2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS, THEY HAVE BEEN WEIGHING IN IN FAVOR OF CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR. BUT REPUBLICANS ARE SEIZED ON HER REMARKS TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT SHE IS DONE PLAYING TERRORISDOWN PLAYING TERRORISM AND WHAT OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER 11th AND MINIMIZING THE THREAT OF TERRORISM.

WELL, OMAR IS ONE OF THE FIRST MUSLIM WOMEN IN CONGRESS. SHE IS UNAPOLOGETICALLY PROGRESSIVE. AND AS SUCH SHE IS A THREAT TO A LOT OF REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW. AND SO OVER THE PAST FEW MOUNTAINS, SHE HAS MADE SOME SLIPUPS. EVERY SINGLE WORD SHE SAYS IS SCRUTINIZED BECAUSE OF HER POSITION AS BEING ONE OF THE FIRST IN CONGRESS. AND SHE MADE A NUMBER OF REMARKS THAT JEWISH MEMBERS INCLUDING JEWISH DEMOCRATS FOUND WERE ANTI-SEMITIC. SHE IS A CRITIC OF ISRAEL. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT LOT IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN RECENT YEARS. ARE OR TN AT ALL. SO SHE'S CHALLENGING THE NORM. AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HER WORD CHOICE AND THE REALITY IS THAT SHE HASN'T BEEN. SO REPUBLICANS HAVE SEIZED ON THAT TO TRY TO SAY THAT SHE HATES JEWS, OR DEMOCRATS DO NOT LIKE THE JEWS AND ARE BECOMING ANTI-SEMITIC.

BUT REPUBLICANS HAVE LONG SAID DEMOCRATS DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO CALL OUT ISLAMIC EXTREMISM. SO, YEAH, AND EXPERTS HAVE ALSO SAID THAT WHEN IT COMES TO IS M ISLAMIC EXTREMISM, THE BIGGEST -- THE WAY TO ERADICATE THAT IS TO HAVE THE MUSLIMS CALL OUT FELLOW MUSLIMS. SO NATURALLY SHE COULD HAVE BEEN STRONGER ON THAT. BUT AGAIN TO TAKE THOSE WORDS AND PUT THEM NEXT TO -- \n",

SO IN THIS EXAMPLE FOR INSTANCE HE IS REALLY TALKING ABOUT USING FEDERAL MONEY AND RESOURCES TO ESSENTIALLY PUNISH PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH HIS POLITICS, SO THREATEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE SANCTUARY CITIES THAT HE WILL HAVE AN INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS THERE. AND THAT IS NONSENSICAL AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY HE CAN'T DO IT. THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS SET UP ON THAT PEOPLE COMING IN, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE CLAIMING ASYLUM, YOU CAN HAVE A CREDIBLE FEAR HEARING, THINGS GEARED TO HELP EXPEDITE THE IMMIGRATION PROCESS. AND HE HAS TRIED TO GET AROUND THAT FROM THE BEGINNING. BUT AGAIN, HE APPARENTLY SAID THAT HE WILL PARDON SOMEBODY IF THEY BREAK THE LAW AND NOW HE SAYS THAT HE WILL USE FEDERAL RESOURCES TO TRY TO PUN IN ADDITION PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH HIS POLITICAL AMBITIONS AND HIS POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY, HIS WORDS WILL PROBABLY COME BACK TO HURT HIM. \n",
      "1364 >> WE SHOULD NOTE THAT WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT SUGGESTION THAT HE WOULD PARDON McALEENAN IF HE BROKE THE LAW WAS A JOKE OR NOT. BUT RACHEL, LET ME COME TO YOU. THE PRESIDENT WAS BUCKED BY SOME REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE SENATE WHEN THE RESOLUTION ABOUT THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WENT UP FOR A VOTE. PLENTY OF REPUBLICANS REJECTED THE PLAN TO CLOSE THE BORDER. DO WE KNOW IF REPUBLICANS ARE ALONG FOR THE RIDE ON THIS TRANSPORTING OF IMMIGRANTS TO SANCTUARY CITIES? \n",
      "1395 >> RIGHT NOW IT IS CRICKETS. LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE, THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, HAVE NOT WEIGHED THIS. OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS ARE LOATH TO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE IS SO POPULAR WITH THE BASE. BUT I THINK AGAIN THIS WILL BE SOMEONE THAT REPUBLICANS IN GENERAL ON CAPITOL HILL, IT IS WHERE THE STORY WILL BE NEXT BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS NOT JUST GOING UP AGAINST DEMOCRATS ON THIS. HE IS GOING UP AGAINST HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION. DHS DID NOT WANT TO DO THIS. THAT IS WHY THEY WENT TO CONGRESS AND BLEW THEIS WHENL W. THIS CAME UP TWICE ONCE IN DECEMBER AGAIN DURING THE SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN IN FEBRUARY WHEN THEY WANTED TO SEND THE MIGRANTS TO NANCY PELOSI'S STWRIKT AS P DISTRICT AS PUNISHMENT FOR HER HARD LINE NEGOTIATING. BUT AGAIN, DHS SAID NO, THEY WERE THE ONES WHO SAID LOGISTICALLY THIS MAKES NO SENSE, IT WILL PUT AN UNDUE BURDEN ON THE AGENCY WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY DEALING WITH A CRISIS RIGHT NOW. SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY PUSH BACK ON THE PRESIDENT AND POINT TO THE AGENCY AND SAY LOOK, THEY ARE SENDING DISTRESS SIGNALS AND THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. SO DO THE REPUBLICANS STAND BEHIND THE AGENCY OR DO THIS WITH THE PRESIDENT THAT COULD OBVIOUSLY REV UP THE BASE AND HELP HIM IN 2020. \n",
      "1474 >> MICHAEL, LET ME BRING TO YOU ANOTHER LEGAL ISSUE. AN APPEALS COURT IS TEMPORARILY ALLOWING THE U.S. TO REQUIRES A SIGH L ASYLUM SEEKERS TO WAIT IN MEXICO. THERE WAS A LOWER COURT RULING ON MONDAY THAT PUT A STAY ON THAT AND NOW THIS APPEALS COURT IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT IS ALLOWING THIS TO CONTINUE WHILE THEY COME TO A DECISION ASKING BOTH PARTIES TO COME BACK WITH MORE INFORMATION. AND THE LOWER COURT DETERMINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT SUFFICIENTLY SAFE GUARD AGAINST PEOPLE BEING RETURNED TO WHERE THEIR, QUOTE, LIFE OR FREEDOM WOULD BE THREATENED, CLOSE QUOTE. DO YOU EXPECT THIS POLICY WILL BE UPHELD, THAT PEOPLE COMING FROM THE NRN TORTHERN TRIANGLE COUNTRIES WILL HAVE TO WAIT IN MEXICO? \n",
      "1521 >> I DON'T THINK SO. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE APPELLATE DECISION LEAVES THINGS STATUS QUO FOR A COUPLE DAYS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE COMING HERE. SO THAT IS WHY IT IS AN EXPEDITED PROCESS, WHY THERE IS A CREDIBLE FEAR HEARING. AND SO MY GUESS IS THAT GIVEN SOME FINDING THAT THEY WERE IN MORE JEOPARDY HERE PERHAPS AND THAT WE NEEDED TO KEEP THEM ACROSS THE BORDER, WHILE THE COURT COMES TOGETHER ON THAT. I THINK THAT THERE IS A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW MANY OF THESE FOLKS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN ESPECIALLY ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO ACTUALLY REPORT BACK TO COURT HEARINGS. AND IT IS A HUGE PERCENTAGE, 92% AND UP. DEPENDS IF THERE WAS A MOTHER WITH A CHILD OR A FAMILY, THAT AFFECTS THE NUMBER. BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO REPORT BACK TO COURT AS ORDERED TO DO. SO THE PROCESS CAN WORK. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE WREE SOURCRESOE TO KEEP THE -- \n",

AGAIN, I THINK THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SEEING THE PUSHBACK. WHY WOULD WE TAKE THE RESOURCES WHERE WE HAVE IT SET UP, TAKE THOSE RESOURCES AND HAVE TO RE-ESTABLISH THEM IN OTHER PLACES JUST BECAUSE THOSE PLACES THE PRESIDENT DEEMED TO BE THE HOMES OF HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES. \n",

      "1993 >> AND THIS MORNING THERE ARE TOUGH NEW GUN LAWS IN NEW ZEALAND. A BILL PASSED THAT BANS MOST SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. AND THOSE REFORMS PASSED 26 DAYS AFTER 50 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE ATTACKS ON THOSE TWO MOSQUES IN CHRISTCHURCH. THAT IS REMARKABLY FAST. WE'VE SEEN THIS TYPE OF RAPID RESPONSE AFTER MASS SHOOTINGS BEFORE IN OTHER COUNTRIES. LET'S GO BACK TO 1987, A MAN ARMED WITH A SEMI AUTOMATIC ARRIVAL, SEVERAL OF THEM, KILLED 16 IN ENGLAND. AND A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR LATER, BRITISH LAWMAKERS BANNED SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPON. IN 1996, A MAN WALKED INTO A SCHOOL IN SCOTLAND AND SHOT AND KILLED 16 CHILDREN AND A TEACHER USING HANDGUNS. WITHIN A YEAR AND A HALF, UK LAWMAKERS PASSED A BAN ON THE PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF ALL HAND GUNS IN MAINLAND BRITAIN WITH BROAD PUBLIC SAUPT. THAT SAME YEAR, A MAN MURDERED 35 PEOPLE IN PORT ARTHUR TASMANIA. THE GOVERNMENT ENACTED WHAT ARE SOME 69 STRONGEST AND STRICTEST ASSAULT WEAPONS LAWS IN THE WORLD. AND THEY DID IT IN 12 DAYS. THERE HASN'T BEEN A GUN RELATED MASS KILLING IN AUSTRALIA SINCE. NOW, THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES AROUND THE WORLD.

ONE OF THEIR GUN SELLERS BACKED IT TOO. NATIONAL RICG NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION OF THOO NEW ZEALAND WAS ALSO ON BOARD. THE POINT IS, THERE IS CONTENTIOUS. THEY CANNOT BE REPLICATED IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. SO THAT LENDS ITSELF TO A CRITICAL QUESTION. CAN A COUNTRY OF 330 MILLION REACH CONSENSUS ON A FIRST STEP IN REVERSING MASS SHOOTING DEATHS? IF YOU BELIEVE EXPANDED BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION THE ANSWER IS YES. IN THE WAKE OF PULSE NIGHT CLUB SHOOTING IN 2016, A CBS NEWS POLL FOUND SUPPORT FOR UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR GUN PURCHASES AT 89%. THE FOLLOWING YEAR, AFTER THE SHOOTING DURING A CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL PRACTICE, SUPPORT IN A QUINNIPIAC POLL RESIDENT TOROSE. AND THE 7% AFTER THE PARKLAND SHOOTING. MARGIN OF ERROR WAS 3.4%. REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS, MEN, WOMEN, WHITE, NONWHITE, ALL AGE GROUP, URBAN, RURAL, ALL ABOVE 95% IN FAVOR IN THAT POLL. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAD REACHED CONSENSUS. SOME LAWMAKERS SAY THE IMMEDIATE DAYS AND WEEKS AFTER A MASS SHOOTING IN THE U.S. IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT GUN LAWS EVEN THOUGH MOST AMERICANS FAVOR STRONGER ONES. NEW ZEALANDERS STARTED THE CONVERSATION WITHIN DAYS OF THE WORST MASS SHOOTING IN ITS HISTORY. AND LESS THAN A MONTH LATER, THERE IS NEW LAW. SO HERE IS THE QUESTION. WHEN DO U.S. LAWMAKERS SUGGEST IS THE RIGHT TIME TO TALK ABOUT U.S. GUN LAWS? OR IS THAT NOT THE POINT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

      "33 >>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SERVING UP ANOTHER HEALTHY PLATTER OF CONTEMPT THIS MORNING FOR THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS. HE IS CALLING THAT COURT A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER, OUT OF CONTROL WITH A HORRIBLE REPUTATION, HE CLAIMS. GOING FURTHER, BEDLAM, CHAOS, INJURY AND DEATH WILL FOLLOW IF THE ANYO9th CIRCUIT KEEPS VOTIN AGAINST HIS ISSUES. THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHO YESTERDAY RESPONDED TO THE PRESIDENT FOR ATTACKING THE JUDGE WHO BLOCKED HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER ON ASYLUM. HE SAID THE FOLLOWING, WE DO NOT HAVE OBAMA JUDGES OR TRUMP JUDGES, JOHN ROBERTS WROTE. JUST DEDICATED JUDGES DOING THEIR LEVEL BEST TO DO EQUAL RIGHT TO THOSE APPEARING BEFORE THEM. TODAY THE ADMINISTRATION REPORTEDLY HAS A NEW PLAN FOR MIGRANTS SEEKING ASYLUM AT THE SOUTHWEST BORDER. IT IS CALLED REMAIN IN MEXICO. AND THAT JUST ABOUT SAYS IT ALL. MEANWHILE A NEW CONTROVERSY ERUPTS AROUND THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL OVER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS HE RECEIVED THIS YEAR FOR A SENATE RUN IN 2014. WHO SAYS THERE IS NO NEW NEWS ON A HOLIDAY? WE WILL DIG INTO ALL OF IT. WE THOUGHT THIS WAS A ONE-DAY BATTLE. THE PRESIDENT TOOK ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT AWAY THIS MORNING. \n",
      "120 >> Reporter: YES, HE DID. IF YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A ONE DAY BATTLE, YOU DO NOT KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP. EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T RESPOND TO THE PET'S LATEST REMARKS TONIGHT WHEN HE BLASTED HIM ON TWITTER SAYING, SORRY. PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDED AGAIN CALLING OUT JOHN ROBERTS ONCE AGAIN AND GOING AFTER THE 9th CIRCUIT COURT AFTER HE INITIALLY CRITICIZED THAT DECISION BECAUSE OF A DECISION THEY MADE ABOUT HIS ASYLUM CHANGES THAT HE WANTS TO MAKE. PRESIDENT TRUMP SEEMS GLAD TO BE CONTINUING THIS. IT WAS HIS FIRST MESSAGE OR HIS MESSAGE BEFORE, RIGHT BEFORE HE SENT OUT A HAPPY THANKSGIVING MESSAGE THIS MORNING TO ALL OF HIS FOLLOWERS ON TWITTER. BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE SEEING THE PRESIDENT CONTINUE. THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT SAY WHEN SOMEONE IS CRITICIZING HIM OR HIS ADMINISTRATION, HE IS NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN. INSTEAD HE IS GOING TO DOUBLE DOWN AND CONTINUE PUSHING BACK. THAT'S NOT WHAT SOURCES CLOSE TO JOHN ROBERTS ARE SAYING. THEY DON'T EXPECT HIM TO CONTINUE THIS ARGUMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT AFTER HE OFFERED THAT VERY RARE REBUKE OF HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE'LL SEE WHERE THIS GOES FROM HERE. BUT IT IS THE PRESIDENT FIGHTING WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT ON TWITTER. \n",
      "190 >> SO KAITLYN, THERE IS NOW A PROBE OF THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL MATTHEW WHITTAKER. BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT IS INVOLVED IN HERE. \n",
      "201 >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. MATT WHITAKER IS THE GUY WHO WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR JEFF SESSIONS, NOW THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. HE IS NOW HAVING AN INVESTIGATION LOOKED INTO HIM BECAUSE A WATCHDOG GROUP FILED SOME COMPLAINTS WITH THE OFFICE OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THE SPECIAL COUNSEL THAT IS ROBERT MUELLER THAT IS INVESTIGATING RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION. BUT THEY HAD FILED THIS COMPLAINT AGAINST HIM ALLEGING THEY BELIEVE HE COULD HAVE VIOLATED THE HATCH ACT. IT PROHIBITS FEDERAL EMPLOYEES FROM ACCEPTING POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. THEY SAY THEY BELIEVE MATT WHITAKER MAY HAVE DONE THAT BECAUSE OF SOME DONATIONS MADE TO A COMMITTEE WHEN HE RAN FOR SENATE IN 2014. HE LOST. DID NOT WIN THAT. BUT THOSE WERE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE MADE WHEN HE WAS IN THE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND THEY ARE CAUSING SOME SCRUTINY FOR THAT, AND THEY ARE LOOKING INTO THAT AND WHETHER THAT GOES FORWARD JUST SHOWS THIS RENEWED SCRUTINY ON MATT WHITAKER NOW THAT HE IS LEADING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. \n",
      "256 >> THAT OF COURSE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WELL HE WAS VETTED. THANKS VERY MUCH. WITH ME NOW, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR JOE LOCK HART AND CNN LEGAL ANALYST. THANKS FOR COMING IN ON THIS THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY. WE WILL DRAW ON YOUR WISDOM AND LET YOU GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILIES. IF I COULD START WITH YOU, ALISON. THIS TREND OF ATTACKING INSTITUTIONS BY THIS PRESIDENT CERTAINLY NOT NEW. BUT EXPANDING. I MEAN, WITHIN THE LAST WEEK, ADAM SCHIFF, DEMOCRAT, ADMIRAL BILL McRAVEN, JOHN ROBERTS, REPUBLICAN APPOINTEE AND CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. YOU ADD TO THAT THE PRESIDENT'S PAST ATTACKS ON THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE FBI, WHO IS PUSHING BACK AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT AS HE SEEKS TO ATTACK THESE INSTITUTIONS, IN EFFECT SAYING THAT IF YOU ARE NOT ON MY SIDE, SOMEHOW YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. \n",
      "314 >> WELL, YOU MAY WANT TO ADD THE MEDIA ON THAT LIST AS WELL, JIM. BUT, LOOK, CLEARLY NO ONE IS PUSHING BACK. AND I WOULD IMAGINE IF THEY DID IT WOULD GO WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF RESPONSE FROM THE PRESIDENT. HE IS GOING TO ATTACK THOSE WHO ATTACK HIM, WHO ARE CRITICAL OF HIM AND WHO DON'T SUPPORT HIS POLICY. THAT'S THE WAY HE WAS DURING THE CAMPAIGN. THAT'S THE WHY HE WAS DURING THIS ADMINISTRATION. MY CONCERN IS THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU MENTIONED AND OTHERS THAT HE DOES ATTACK CERTAINLY DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS, WHEREAS HE EMBRACES AND STANDS BEHIND BRUTAL DICTATORS, THAT'S WHERE THE CONCERN IS. IT RAISES QUESTIONS AS TO WHO HE FEELS IS SOMEONE THAT IS WORTHY OF HIS SCORN AND CRITICISM AND WHO HE FEELS IS SOMEONE THAT NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED. THAT IS WHERE THERE IS GREAT CONCERN. \n",
      "370 >> I WONDER IF WE AS A COUNTRY SOMETIMES ARE THE FROG IN THE BOILING POT OF WATER. THE TEMPERATURE IS RISING BUT BECAUSE EVERY DAY THERE IS SOMETHING YOU'RE LIKE, DOES THIS ONE REALLY MATTER, DOES THIS ONE REALLY MATTER. BUT TAKEN TOGETHER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONNECT THE DOTS FOR PEOPLE THAT THE PRESIDENT RAISED REAL QUESTIONS THAT IS UNDERMINING SOME AMERICANS CONFIDENCE IT APPEARS IN ALL THESE INSTITUTIONS. \n",
      "394 >> NO. I THINK WE GET CAUGHT UP IN THE PERSONALITY AND EXAMINING WHY TRUMP IS DOING THIS. THERE IS REALLY DANGEROUS STUFF GOING ON HERE. IF YOU LOOK BACK JUST TO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY, YOU HAD DICTATORS MOVING FORWARD, AND YOU HAD PEOPLE APPEASING THOSE DICTATORS, HITLER AND MUSILENNI. IF HE DOESN'T NEGOTIATE PEOPLE, HE DEMEANS THEM. I THINK IT IS VERY SCAREY. RIGHT NOW, THE REPUBLICAN LEADER IS APPEASING THE PRESIDENT. THERE IS NO OTHER WORD FOR IT. IT IS DANGEROUS WHEN THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT TRUMP. WE MAY COME OUT OF THIS TRUMP ERA HOPEFULLY IN JUST ANOTHER TWO YEARS WITH A COUNTRY THAT NO LONGER BELIEVES IN THE MEDIA, NO LONGER BELIEVES IN THE JUDICIARY, NO LONGER BELIEVES IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, NO LONGER BELIEVES IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THAT IS RIGHT BEFORE AUTHORITARIANISM. WE DO HAVE TO STEP BACK FROM THE DAILY TWEETING AND WHAT HIS STAGE IS. HE SAID IT AT THE CONVENTION. WE LIVE IN A DARK WORLD AND ONLY I CAN SAY THIS. IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT. \n",
      "471 >> I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS WITH JOHN ROBERTS. YOU HAVE THE CHIEF JUSTICE. BUT ALSO SOMEONE WHO IS VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE COURT'S REPUTATION AND IT'S STANDING IN AMERICAN SOCIETY. THAT APPEARS TO BE HIS MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS RARE STATEMENT CONTRADICTING THE PRESIDENT HERE. HE'S NOT SOMEONE TO HOLD GRUDGES, BUT I WONDER IF THE PRESIDENT'S ATTACK ON HIM COULD BACKFIRE, THAT IN THESE MANY CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS COMING BEFORE THE COURT, MANY OF WHICH MIGHT BE A FIVE-FOUR KIND OF DECISION, THAT THIS JUSTICE IS ONE WHO MIGHT BE MOTIVATED TO MAKE A STAND FOR THE COURT'S PERCEPTION OF NOT BEING PARTISAN THAT SETS YOU UP FOR LOSING FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PERSPECTIVE SOME OF THESE CASES. DO YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THAT? \n",
      "522 >> YEAH. ALTHOUGH NOT CERTAIN WITH JOHN ROBERTS. I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY HE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL CONSERVATIVE, AND I THINK THAT HE WILL RULE ON CASES BEFORE HIM BASED ON THE LAW IN FRONT OF HIM, NOT THE POLITICS OF THE SITUATION IN WHICH HE FINDS HIMSELF, WHICH IS REALLY IN SOME SENSE UNTENABLE FOR HIM. BUT IT COULD BE HE FINDS A WAY LIKE WITH THE UPHOLDING OF THE OBAMA CARE DECISION TO LOOK FOR A LEGAL WAY TO UPHOLD IT FOR POLITICAL END. I DON'T EXPECT THAT. BUT TO THE POINT THAT YOU ARE RAISING, JIM, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE'S SO DISGUSTED WITH WHAT'S GOING ON HERE THAT HE LOOKS FOR ALTERNATIVES. \n",
      "561 >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LATEST CHALLENGE TO MATT WHITAKER. THIS ONE HERE FOR FOLKS AT HOME WHO AREN'T FOLLOWING, AN OBSCURE CAMPAIGN LAW. DID HE TAKE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN HE HELD ANOTHER ROLE IN GOVERNMENT. ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT ALL THESE QUESTIONS CIRCLING AROUND MATT WHITAKER UNDERMINE HIS FUTURE AS THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL? \n",
      "589 >> I THINK HE AND EVERYONE REALIZED ONCE HIS NAME WAS ANNOUNCED IN HIS POSITION, HE WAS GOING TO FACE TREMENDOUS SCRUTINY. IT IS A BIG POSITION. IT IS A CRITICAL TIME IF OUR NATION. BUT AS FOR THIS CURRENT PROBE WITH REGARD TO THE HATCH ACT, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN ON MANY CAMPAIGNS, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO WORK YEARS LATER TO TRY AND RETIRE A CAMPAIGN DEBT, WHICH IS WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. HE HAD ABOUT $50,000 IN OUTSTANDING DEBT AND MUCH OF WHICH HE DONATED HIMSELF AND SOMEONE STEPPED UP AND MADE A CONTRIBUTION TO HELP RETIRE THAT DEBT. THE QUESTION WILL REMAIN AND HIS TREASURER SAYS HE DIDN'T ASK FOR IT. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE THIS. IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT'S UNTHWART, I WOULD ASSUME THE RIGHT THING WOULD BE TO PAY THE MONEY BACK. IT IS A VALID CONCERN GIVEN THE IMPORTANT POSITION HE'S IN NOW. BUT I'M SURE IF THEY FIND SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED, HE WILL DO SO. \n",
      "646 >> DO YOU THINK THESE ARE CORRECTABLISH YE ISSUES WITH TH ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR ARE THEY ONES THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT GOING TO LET GO OF? \n",
      "656 >> YEAH. I THINK IT REPRESENTS A PATTERN. YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S NOT A STRETCH TO SAY THAT HE'S NOT FIT TO BE THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL, MUCH LESS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THERE IS A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WENT ON WITH THE PRESIDENT BEFORE HE WAS ELEVATED WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS. SO I DON'T EXPECT THAT THIS PARTICULAR HATCH ACT VIOLATION IS WHAT WILL BRING HIM DOWN. I THINK IT'S THE OVER ALL. TAKING A STEP BACK, THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO IMPEDE THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. BY PUTTING SOMEONE CLEARLY NOT QUALIFIED, SOMEONE WHO WILL FOLLOW HIS MARCHING ORDERS AND SOMEONE WHO LIKELY WHEN BOB MUELLER SAYS I NEED TO TALK TO THE PRESIDENT, I WANT A SUBPOENA, IS LIKELY TO TELL THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE VETO POWER OVER THAT. THAT VIOLATES EVERY TENANT OF WHAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. \n",
      "723 >> SO, MICHAEL, WHAT IS HOLDING THE PRESIDENT BACK ABOUT THIS? WE TALKED ABOUT A SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE IN SLOW MOTION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS INSTALLED AS ATTORNEY GENERAL AND AS THE OVERSEER IN FACT MUELLER INVESTIGATION IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT IS INVOLVED, A FRIENDLY ACTOR HERE. WHAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF THAT REMAINING THE REALITY? \n",
      "744 >> DEMOCRATIC HOUSE THAT MAY BY AND LARGE BE IMPEACHED FOR ABUSE OF POWER. \n",
      "752 >> AGAINST THE PRESIDENT? \n",
      "753 >> YEAH, SURE. BECAUSE IF WHAT THEY HAVE DONE HERE IS A SLOW MOTION SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE. THAT IS, THEY HAVE PUT IN A PERSON WHO WILL NOW TRY TO CAP DATE THE WORK OF THE SPECIAL DOWN SO THAT HE CANNOT PROCEED TO A CONCLUSION, THAT HAS TO BE REPORTED TO THE HOUSE JUDICIARY AND SENATE JUDICIARY AND SENATE INTELLIGENCE FOR INQUIRY. IF THEY FIND THAT IN THE COURSE OF THAT INQUIRY THAT THIS WAS DONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTERFERING WITH HIS INVESTIGATION, THAT'S AN ABUSE OF OFFICE, THAT INQUIRY. SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE HOLDING HIM BACK. THAT'S WHAT McGAHN TOLD HIM WHEN HE SAID HE WANTED TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST COMEY AND HILLARY CLINTON JUST THE OTHER WEEK WE LEARNED THAT. AND McGAHN SAID YOU CAN DO THAT CONSTITUTIONALLY, BUT YOU RUN THE RISK OF ABUSING YOUR OFFICE AND ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT COULD FOLLOW. I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST GOVERNOR ON HIS BEHAVIOR. \n",
      "813 >> IT IS A HIGH BAR. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING -- WAS THAT YOU, JOE? I HEARD A DOG IN THE BACKGROUND. \n",
      "822 >> THAT WAS MY DOG. \n",
      "823 >> HE WANTED TO PIPE IN ON THE DISCUSSION? DID HE HAVE ANY WISDOM HE COULD TRANSLATE FOR THE PANEL? \n",
      "830 >> I THINK HE AGREES WITH EVERYTHING I SAY. \n",
      "833 >> SMART DOG. \n",
      "834 >> HE'S WAITING FOR SOME LEFTOVERS. JIM, IF I COULD QUICKLY SAY. \n",
      "839 >> PLEASE. \n",
      "840 >> NOT ONLY IS THE PRESIDENT GETTING LEGAL ADVICE TO MAKE SURE AND NOT OBSTRUCT THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. WHEN YOU TRAVEL AROUND IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, A LOT OF HIS BASE AND REPUBLICAN VOTERS SAY THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING IS DONE TO STOP MUELLER AND WHAT HE IS DOING IN HIS INVESTIGATION. AND THE PRESIDENT KNOWS THAT. HE UNDERSTANDS THERE WILL BE SOME PUSHBACK FROM HIS BASE IF WE WERE TO DO ANYTHING. SO I DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING ON HIS PART RELATED TO SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS THERE WILL BE SOME CONSEQUENCES. \n",
      "871 >> VERY HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL OF YOU. \n",
      "874 >> YOU, TOO. \n",
      "875 >> THANKS FOR COMING IN. \n",
      "877 >>> WELL, THE 92nd ANNUAL MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE IS WINDING THROUGH THE STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW.

      "165 >>> SAUDI ARABIA IS USING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OWN WORDS TO CAST DOUBT ON THE CIA HIGH CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT THAT THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE ORDERED THE MURDER OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI, ARGUE GUING THAT U.S. INTEL IS UNRELIABLE, POINTING TO THESE REMARKS BY THE U.S. PRESIDENT. \n",
      "184 >> THE CIA HAS LOOKED AT IT. THEY HAVE STUDIED IT A LOT. THEY HAVE NOTHING DEFINITIVE. AND THE FACT IS MAYBE HE DID. MAYBE HE DIDN'T. \n",
      "194 >> WHOSE SIDE IS THE PRESIDENT TAKING HERE, SAUDI ARABIA'S OR THE U.S.'S? LET'S DISCUSS. SO SAMANTHA, QUITE A MOMENT HERE, AND I IMAGINE PREDICTABLE. THE PRESIDENT UNDERMINES U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES BY QUESTIONING THEIR HIGH CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT, WHICH IS AS HIGH CONFIDENCE OR AS DEFINITIVE AS INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENTS GET. AND THE SAUDIS PARROT THAT BACK. HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM IS THAT FOR THE U.S.? \n",
      "220 >> IT IS A PROBLEM, JIM, BECAUSE INTELLIGENCE ON TO ITSELF DOESN'T MAKE POLICY. INTELLIGENCE IS GEARED TOWARD ITS NUMBER ONE CUSTOMER. THAT IS TYPICALLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IF THE PRESIDENT CHOOSES NOT TO INTEGRATE IT INTO A POLICY PROCESS, THE BUCK REALLY STOPS WITH HIM. AND THE ISSUE, JIM, IS WE MIGHT SEE A VERY PUBLIC DIVIDE OVER THE COMING WEEKS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CIVSEVERAL OT ALLIES. COUNTRIES HAVE COME TOGETHER TO HOLD SAUDI ARABIA ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MURDER OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI. WE HAD DENMARK ANNOUNCE THEY ARE CUTTING OFF ARMS SALES. MACRON IS LOOKING AT SANCTIONS AS WELL. IT MAY VERY QUICKLY TURN INTO A CASE OF WARRING ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT DID OR DID NOT HAPPEN. WE WILL HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ON ONE SIDE SIDING WITH SAUDI ARABIA. AND THEN OUR OTHER ALLIES, THE ONES THAT DON'T MURDER AMERICAN RESIDENTS AND JOURNALISTS ON THE OTHER. \n",
      "278 >> THE THING IS THE FACTS ARE ON ONE SIDE HERE. THE EVIDENCE, THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT YOU AND I KNOW ARE CONSERVATIVE IN MAKING ASSESSMENTS. BUT THEY WERE HIGH CONFIDENCE HERE, WHICH LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD THE GOODS TO PLACE BLAME ON THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE. \n",
      "298 >> YES. LET ME JUST BE VERY CLEAR. I WORKED AT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY FOR MANY YEARS, VARIOUS PARTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THERE ARE NO MAYBES IN INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENTS, PARTICULARLY HIGH CONFIDENCE ONES. WHAT A HIGH CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT NEEDS IS THAT VARIOUS PARTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT BASED UPON THE KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY'RE INTEGRATING INTO THAT ASSESSMENT. PERHAPS A PHONE CALL THAT'S INDISPUTABLE AND OTHER BITS OF INTEL THAT COMES IN. IT MEANS THERE IS VERY LITTLE DOUBT. SO THIS BEING A HIGH CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT TYPICALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. AND IN THE SECOND TO USE IT TO INFORM POLICY DECISIONS AND REALLY TO PRIORITIZE WHICH EQUITIES HE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO. SO THE PRESIDENT TWEETED EARLIER THIS MORNING ABOUT OIL AND JOBS BEING PARAMOUNT. WELL, TYPICALLY YOU'D HAVE THE PRESIDENT REALLY PLACE THE PHYSICAL SECURITY OF AMERICAN RESIDENTS LIKE JAMAL KHASHOGGI ABOVE OIL AND JOBS. \n",
      "362 >> ANOTHER HIGH CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP UNDERMINES QUESTIONS, RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE U.S. ELECTION. \n",
      "370 >> AND PUTIN LIKES TO PARROT THAT AROUND AS WELL. \n",
      "373 >> THE PUBLISHER IN \"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" OF COURSE THAT THE PUBLICATION THAT JAMAL KHASHOGGI WROTE FOR, HE RESPONDED AGAIN TO THE PRESIDENT VERY STRONGLY WORDED COLUMN. AND I WANT TO READ SOME OF THAT. HE SAID TRUMP'S RESPONSE DOES NOT ADVANCE THE UNITED STATES INTERESTS. IT BETRAYS THEM AND PLACES THE DOLLAR VALUES OF COMMERCIAL DEALS ON RESPECTING LIBERTY AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP ABOVE THE UNITED STATES STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WARM AND FUZZY VALUES HERE, IS IT?

      "416 >> IT DOES. AND DONALD TRUMP IS NOT THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO CARE ABOUT OIL AND JOBS BY THE WAY. I WORKED WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA TO TALK ABOUT THEIR OIL PRODUCTION. THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT WARM AND FUZZY VALUES. IT IS ABOUT PHYSICAL SECURITY. WE KNOW AN AMERICAN RESIDENT WAS MURDERED. THAT IS A GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE. BUT THE PROBLEM NOW IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS SIGNALING THAT IF YOU PUMP MORE OIL OR IF YOU WAIVE A MEMORANDUM OF INTENT ABOUT ARMS DEALS IN FRONT OF HIM, HE WILL LET A MURDER GO. FROM AN INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE, I WOULD GUESS THE INTEL COMMUNITY IS TELLING THE PRESIDENT, IF HE'S LISTEN, THIS IS GOING TO ENCOURAGE MORE MURDERS TO CONDUCT MORE CRIMES JUST AS LONG AS THEY PROMISE TO SIGN A WEAPONS DEAL WITH THE UNITED STATES. THIS COULD REALLY IMPACT THE PHYSICAL SECURITY OF AMERICANS AND OTHERS AROUND THE GLOBE GOING FORWARD. \n",

A CLIMATE SCIENTIST AND DIRECTOR TOLD CNN EARLIER THIS YEAR, QUOTE, WE WERE SEEING THEM PLAY OUT IN REALTIME IN THE FORM OF UNPRECEDENTED HEAT WAVES. DROUGHTS AND WILD FIRES, AND WE HAVE SEEN THEM ALL. NOTING A COLD SNAP IN THE MIDST OF THAT RISE IS SILLY. NOT AS SILLY AS BRINGING A SNOWBALL ON TO THE SENATE FLOOR DURING ONE OF THE PREVIOUS YEARS ON RECORD TO QUESTION THE HARD DATA OF A WARMING EARTH, WHICH YOU MAY REMEMBER IS EXACTLY WHAT A REPUBLICAN SENATOR, THEN CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE'S ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE DID IN 2015.

THERE ARE U.S. TROOPS IN KUWAIT, IN QUATAR, IN DUBAI AND THOSE U.S. NAVY SHIPS THAT GO UP AND DOWN THE PERSIAN GULF WATERS ALL THE TIME. THERE ARE PATRIOT MISSILES IN VARIOUS AREAS OF THIS MIDDLE EAST REGION. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IRANIANS, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT CAPABILITIES. DO THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO STRIKE OUT WITH THEIR MISSILES? PROBABLY THEY DO. CAN THE U.S. DEFEND? YES. COULD THEY GET THROUGH WITH A SINGLE MISSILE? THEY COULD PERHAPS, BUT IT IS THE INTENTIONS. WHY ARE THE IE RYRANIANS SAYING THIS? DO THEY HAVE ANY REASONABLE INTENTION, IF YOU WILL, OF STRIKING THE UNITED STATES?

THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU TYPICALLY SEE THE TOP COMMANDER DOING. HIS SECURITY PERSONNEL, WHO HAVE TO PROTECT HIM, AROUND HIM, THEY ARE FULLY ARMED. BUT GENERAL MILLER WAS, OF COURSE, IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIRE FIGHT ESSENTIALLY LAST MONTH, SO THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT THESE INSIDER ATTACKS, CONCERNS ABOUT THESE AREAS OF AFGHANISTAN WHERE THE TALIBAN IS RESURGENT.

IF YOU THINK OF WHAT THAT MEANS, OVER 12,000 PEOPLE. THEY WENT INTO SEAS AND THEY WENT INTO AREAS THAT NOBODY ELSE WOULD GO INTO, AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN TEXAS, WHAT THEY DID IN FLORIDA, WHAT THEY DID IN PUERTO RICO. THE COAST GUARD HAS REALLY BECOME A SYMBOL OF STRENGTH AND PERSEVERANCE AND GENIUS, REALLY. SO HELLO TO LIEUTENANT NICHOLAS HARTMAN, THE COMMANDING OFFICER. AND I ALSO WANT TO CONGRATULATE CHRISTOPHER WILSON ON BEING SELECTED FOR A SCHOOL. THAT'S A. THAT'S THE BEST, RIGHT? YOU TRULY MAKE US PROUD. CONGRATULATIONS. THAT'S A BIG DEAL.
